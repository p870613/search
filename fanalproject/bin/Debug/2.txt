Adverse drug reactions can cause considerable discomfort. They can be
life-threatening in severe cases, requiring or prolonging hospitalization,
impeding proper treatment, and increasing treatment costs considerably. Although 
the incidence of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) is low, they can be
serious, have permanent sequelae, or lead to death. A recent pharmacogenomic
study confirmed that genetic factors can predispose an individual to SCARs.
Genetic markers enable not only elucidation of the pathogenesis of SCARs, but
also screening of susceptible subjects. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
genotypes associated with SCARs include HLA-B*57:01 for abacavir (Caucasians),
HLA-B*58:01 for allopurinol (Asians), HLA-B*15:02 (Han Chinese) and HLA-A*31:01
(Europeans and Koreans) for carbamazepine, HLA-B*59:01 for methazolamide (Koreans
and Japanese), and HLA-B*13:01 for dapsone (Asians). Therefore, prescreening
genetic testing could prevent severe drug hypersensitivity reactions. Large-scale
epidemiologic studies are required to demonstrate the usefulness and
cost-effectiveness of screening tests because their efficacy is affected by the
genetic differences among ethnicities.

BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) vertical transmission may lead to microcephaly and 
other congenital anomalies. In March and April 2016, the first outbreak of ZIKV
occurred in Argentina. The objective was to describe the surveillance of newborns
with microcephaly and other selected brain anomalies in Argentina, and evaluation
different etiologies.
METHODS: Participants were enrolled between April 2016 and March 2017.
CASES: newborns from the National Network of Congenital Abnormalities of
Argentina (RENAC) with head circumference lower than the 3rd percentile according
to gestational age and sex, or selected brain anomalies. Blood and urine samples 
from cases and their mothers were tested for ZIKV by real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR), antigen-specific Immunoglobulin M (MAC-ELISA) and
plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT90 ). Toxoplasmosis, rubella, herpes
simplex, syphilis, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection were also tested.
RESULTS: A total of 104 cases were reported, with a prevalence of 6.9 per 10,000 
[95% confidence interval (CI): 5.7-8.4], a significant increase when compared
with the data prior to 2016, Prevalence Rate Ratio 1.7 (95% CI 1.2-2.3). In five 
cases positive serology for ZIKV (IgM and IgG by PRNT) was detected. The five
cases presented microcephaly with craniofacial disproportion. We detected four
cases of CMV infection, three cases of congenital toxoplasmosis, two cases of
herpes simplex infection, and one case of congenital syphilis.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of microcephaly was significantly higher when compared
with the previous period. The system had the capacity to detect five cases with
congenital ZIKV syndrome in a country with limited viral circulation.

Down-regulation of CD5 and dysregulated CD8+ T-cell activation.

Wada T(1).

Author information:

Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.

CD5 is a cell surface molecule that is expressed on most circulating T cells and 
a small population of B cells and is involved in modulation of antigen-specific
receptor-mediated activation. Down-regulation of CD5 on CD8+ T cells is a poorly 
understood but increasingly recognized phenomenon that may be associated with
dysregulated T-cell activation. An increased subpopulation of activated CD8+ T
cells with down-regulation of CD5 has recently been described in patients with
Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and
familial HLH caused by perforin deficiency and Munc 13-4 deficiency. These cells 
were detectable only in the acute phase of HLH, in which patients exhibited
hypercytokinemia, and declined progressively after successful treatment in
parallel with improvement of systemic inflammation. It is unknown whether CD8+ T 
cells from HLH with other causes have similar profiles. Assessment of CD5
expression on T cells has the potential to assist in understanding of the
diagnosis and pathogenesis of human inflammatory diseases such as HLH. This

INTRODUCTION: The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) based prostate cancer (PC)
screening is currently being debated. The current assessment is to understand the
variability of detecting high-risk PC in a NZ cohort in comparison to a US cohort
with better PSA screening facilities. Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) is known
for multiple functions with a potential to regulate subsequent PSA levels.
Therefore, we wish to understand the influence of tobacco smoking and the AKR1C3 
rs12529 gene polymorphism in this variability.
METHOD: NZ cohort (n = 376) consisted of 94% Caucasians while the US cohort
consisted of African Americans (AA), n = 202, and European Americans (EA), n =
232. PSA level, PC grade and stage at diagnosis were collected from hospital
databases for assigning high-risk PC status. Tobacco smoking status and the
AKR1C3 rs12529 SNP genotype were considered as confounding variables. Variation
of the cumulative % high-risk PC (outcome variable) with increasing PSA intervals
(exposure factor) was compared between the cohorts using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test. Comparisons were carried out with and without stratifications made using
confounding variables.
RESULTS: NZ cohort has been diagnosed at a significantly higher mean age (66.67¡Ó 
(8.08) y) compared to both AA (62.65¡Ó8.17y) and EA (64.83+8.56y); median PSA (NZ 
8.90ng/ml compared to AA 6.86ng/ml and EA 5.80ng/ml); and Gleason sum (NZ (7)
compared EA (6)) (p<0.05). The cumulative % high-risk PC detection shows NZ
cohort with a significantly lower diagnosis rates at PSA levels between >6 -
<10ng/ml compared to both US groups (p<0.05). These were further compounded
significantly by smoking status and genetics.
CONCLUSIONS: High-risk PCs recorded at higher PSA levels in NZ could be due to
factors including lower levels of PSA screening and subsequent specialist
referrals for biopsies. These consequences could be pronounced among NZ ever
smokers carrying the AKR1C3 rs12529 G alleles making them a group that requires
increased PSA screening attention.

Tuberculosis is a menacing disease caused eminently to the people inhabiting the 
tropical and sub-tropical nations. A holistic approach is required to generate T 
and B memory cells to effectuate a long-term exemption from the pulmonary
tuberculosis. In this study, immunoinformatic approaches were used to design a
multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine for pulmonary tuberculosis which may improve 
human immune system. The various B-cell, TH cell and TC cell binding epitopes
were predicted for selected 2 membrane and 12 secretory proteins of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. The final vaccine construct was assembled by merging the predicted 
epitope sequences and an adjuvant at the N-terminal of the construct.
Furthermore, the physiochemical characterization was done to check the molecular 
weight, aliphatic index, theoretical PI, hydropathicity and thermostable nature
of the designed vaccine. The construct was a potential antigen while wasn't
allergenic in nature. Tertiary modeling was performed, by filtering them a
refined model was chosen and was docked with TLR-4 (immune receptor). Molecular
docking and dynamic simulation was performed and the microscopic interaction
between the vaccine construct (ligand) and TLR-4 receptor complex was verified.
In silico cloning was used to fortify the expression and translation efficiency
of the vaccine within an expression vector.

BACKGROUND: Serum IL-22 levels are elevated in atopic dermatitis (AD), which
commonly precedes asthma in the atopic march. Epicutaneous (EC) sensitization in 
mice results in Th2-dominated skin inflammation that mimics AD, and sensitizes
the airways for antigen challenge-induced allergic inflammation characterized by 
the presence of both eosinophils and neutrophils. EC sensitization results in
elevated serum levels of IL-22.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of IL-22 in antigen-driven airway allergic
inflammation following inhalation challenge in EC sensitized mice.
METHODS: Wild type (WT) and Il22-/- mice were EC sensitized or intraperitoneally 
(i.p.) immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) and intranasally challenged with antigen.
OVA TCR-specific T cells were Th22 polarized in vitro. Airway inflammation, mRNA 
levels in the lungs and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) were examined.
RESULTS: EC sensitization preferentially elicited an IL-22 response compared to
i.p. immunization. Intranasal challenge of mice EC-sensitized with OVA elicited
in the lungs Il22 mRNA expression, IL-22 production and accumulation of
CD3+CD4+IL22+ T cells that co-expressed IL-17A and TNF£\. EC-sensitized Il22-/-
mice exhibited diminished eosinophil and neutrophil airway infiltration, and
decreased AHR following intranasal OVA challenge. Production of IL-13, IL-17A and
TNF£\ was normal, but IFN£^ production was increased in lung cells from
airway-challenged EC-sensitized Il22-/- mice. Intranasal instillation of IFN£^
neutralizing antibody partially reversed the defect in eosinophil recruitment. WT
recipients of Th22 polarized WT, but not IL-22 deficient, TCR-OVA specific T
cells, which both secrete IL-17A and TNF£\, developed neutrophil-dominated airway 
inflammation and AHR upon intranasal OVA challenge. Intranasal instillation of
IL-22 with TNF£\, but not IL-17A, elicited neutrophil-dominated airway
inflammation, and AHR in WT mice, suggesting that the loss of IL-22 synergy with 
TNF£\ contributed to the defective recruitment of neutrophils into the airways of 
Il22-/- mice. TNF£\, but not IL-22 blockade at the time of antigen inhalation
challenge inhibited airway inflammation in EC sensitized mice CONCLUSION: EC
sensitization promotes the generation of antigen-specific IL-22 producing T cells
that promote airway inflammation and AHR following antigen challenge, suggesting 
that IL-22 plays an important role in the atopic march.

BACKGROUND: Neutrophils and allergen-specific T-cells accumulate in allergic
late-phase reactions (LPR). Their presence is associated with severe
inflammation. Cytokines like GM-CSF, IFN-£^, and IL-3, typically found in allergic
LPR, have been proposed to convert neutrophils into antigen-presenting cells
(APC).
OBJECTIVE: To assess the antigen-processing and presenting capacity of
neutrophils from allergic patients.
METHODS: Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood of birch pollen-allergic
donors and stimulated with GM-CSF, IFN-£^, and IL-3. Viability and expression of
HLA-DR, CD80, and CD86 were assessed by flow cytometry. HLA-DM expression was
analysed by immunoblotting. Allergen-uptake was studied with
fluorescence-labelled major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1. Bet v 1 was digested
with neutrophilic endolysosomal extracts and resulting fragments were sequenced
using mass spectrometry. Neutrophils were used as APC in co-culture experiments
with autologous HLA-DR-restricted Bet v 1-specific T-cell clones reactive with
epitopes in different regions of the allergen. In all experiments, monocytes were
used for comparison. Fluids from suction blisters formed on top of LPR induced by
intradermal allergen injection were assessed for HLA-DR-positive neutrophils by
flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The cytokines significantly enhanced the survival, allergen uptake and
expression of HLA-DM and HLA-DR of neutrophils. Neutrophils rapidly degraded Bet 
v 1 into fragments containing all relevant T-cell epitopes. Cytokine-activated,
allergen-pulsed neutrophils induced proliferative and cytokine responses of Bet v
1-specific T-cells irrespective of epitope specificity confirming that they fully
processed and presented the allergen. HLA-DR-positive neutrophils were detected
in cutaneous allergic LPR.
CONCLUSION: Neutrophils may serve as APC for local allergen-specific effector
T-cells in allergic LPR.

Recent evidence implicates adaptive immunity as a key player in the mechanisms
supporting hepatic inflammation during the progression of nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD). In these settings, patients with NAFLD often show an
increase in the circulating levels of antibodies against oxidative stress-derived
epitopes (OSE). Nonetheless, the actual role of humoral immunity in NAFLD is
still unclear. This study investigates the contribution of B-lymphocytes to NAFLD
evolution. B-lymphocyte immunostaining of liver biopsies from NAFLD patients
showed that B-cells were evident within cell aggregates rich in T-lymphocytes. In
these subjects, B/T-lymphocyte infiltration positively correlated with both
circulating IgG targeting oxidative stress-derived epitopes (OSE) and
interferon-£^ (IFN-£^) levels. Furthermore, high prevalence of lymphocyte
aggregates identified patients with more severe lobular inflammation and
fibrosis. In mouse models of NAFLD, the onset of steatohepatitis was
characterized by hepatic B2-lymphocytes maturation to plasma cells and by an
elevation in circulating anti-OSE IgG titers. B-cell responses preceded T-cell
activation and were accompanied by the up-regulation in the hepatic expression of
B-cell Activating Factor (BAFF). Selective B2-cell depletion in mice
over-expressing a soluble form of the BAFF/APRIL receptor Transmembrane Activator
and Cyclophilin Ligand Interactor (TACI-Ig) prevented plasma cell maturation and 
Th-1 activation of liver CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Furthermore, TACI-Ig mice showed
milder steatohepatitis and a decreased progression to fibrosis. Similarly, mice
treatment with the BAFF-neutralizing monoclonal antibody Sandy-2 prevented
hepatic B2-cell responses and ameliorated steatohepatitis. From these data we
conclude that B2-lymphocyte activation is an early event in NAFLD evolution and
contributes to the disease progression through the interaction with T-cells.
Furthermore, combined clinical and experimental data suggest that elevated
circulating anti-OSE IgG can identify a subset of NAFLD patients in whom adaptive
immunity has a relevant role in the disease evolution toward fibrosis.

An important emerging form of immunotherapy targeting B cell malignancies is
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. Despite encouraging response
rates of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in B cell lymphomas, limited durability of 
response necessitates further study to potentiate CAR T cell efficacy.
Antibody-targeted interferon (IFN) therapy is a novel approach in immunotherapy. 
Given the ability of IFNs to promote T cell activation and survival, target cell 
recognition, and cytotoxicity, we asked whether antibody-targeted IFN could
enhance the antitumor effects of anti-CD19 CAR T cells. We produced an
anti-CD20-IFN fusion protein containing the potent type 1 IFN isoform alpha14
(£\14), and demonstrated its ability to suppress proliferation and induce
apoptosis of human B cell lymphomas. Indeed, with the combination of
anti-CD20-hIFN£\14 and CAR T cells, we found enhanced cell killing among B cell
lymphoma lines. Importantly, for all cell lines pretreated with
anti-CD20-hIFN£\14, the subsequent cytokine production by CAR T cells was markedly
increased regardless of the degree of cell killing. Thus, several activities of
CD19 CAR T cells were enhanced in the presence of anti-CD20-hIFN£\14. These data
suggest that antibody-targeted IFN may be an important novel approach to
improving the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy.

Hexavalent vaccines: increasing options for policy-makers and providers. A review
of the data supporting interchangeability (substitution with vaccines containing 
fewer antigens) and mixed schedules from the same manufacturer.

INTRODUCTION: Combination vaccines improve vaccine uptake and open the infant
immunization space for additional vaccines. Hexavalent vaccines have been
marketed since 2000. Infanrix hexa (combined diphtheria-tetanus-acellular
pertussis-hepatitis B-inactivated poliovirus-Haemophilus influenzae type b
conjugate vaccine, DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib, GSK) is longest on the market, providing
16?years post-marketing experience. Each DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine component is
licensed alone and/or in smaller combination vaccines. Programmatic
considerations sometimes require an interchange between vaccines due to
unavailability, program change or mixed schedules (when the number of required
antigens differs across scheduled primary vaccination visits). Areas covered:
Immunogenicity and safety data from 11 GSK-sponsored clinical trials support the 
interchangeability of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib within the same vaccines family, and use
of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib in mixed primary vaccination schedules. Expert commentary:
Data show acceptability of interchange of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib with other products
within the same vaccines family and its use in mixed immunization schedules. This
aligns with WHO recommendations that vaccines of the same family from the same
manufacturer be used to complete the infant vaccination schedule.
Interchangeability and suitability for use in mixed schedules is of interest for 
policy-makers/providers in the framework of vaccination recommendations as it
provides flexibility. Given the complexity of larger combination vaccines,
interchangeability or sequential use needs careful assessment.

Effects of linker modification on tumor-to-kidney contrast of 68Ga-labeled
PSMA-targeted imaging probes.

Kuo HT, Pan J, Zhang Z, Lau J, Merkens H, Zhang C, Colpo N, Lin KS, Benard F.

68Ga-PSMA-11 is currently the most popular prostate-specific membrane antigen
(PSMA) radioligand used in the clinic to detect prostate cancer and metastases.
However, the high uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in kidneys can create halo-artifacts
resulting in lower detection sensitivity for lesions adjacent to the kidneys. In 
this study, we developed two 68Ga-labeled PSMA-targeted tracers, 68Ga-HTK01166
and 68Ga-HTK01167, based on 68Ga-PSMA-617 with the goal of improving
tumor-to-kidney ratio compared to 68Ga-PSMA-11. The 2-naphthylalanine (2-Nal) in 
PSMA-617 was replaced with 2-indanylglycine (Igl) or 3,3-diphenylalanine (Dip) to
synthesize HTK01166 and HTK01167, respectively. Binding affinities (Ki) of
Ga-PSMA-11, Ga-PSMA-617, Ga-HTK01166 and Ga-HTK01167 to PSMA were 3.13 ¡Ó 0.40,
1.23 ¡Ó 0.08, 5.74 ¡Ó 2.48 and 25.7 ¡Ó 9.84 nM, respectively, as determined by in
vitro competition binding assays. 68Ga labeling was performed in HEPES buffer
with microwave heating, and 68Ga-labeled PSMA-11, PSMA-617, HTK01166 and HTK01167
were obtained in 46 - 69% average decay-corrected radiochemical yield with >99%
radiochemical purity and 62.9 - 152 GBq/£gmol average specific activity. PET
imaging and biodistribution studies were performed in mice bearing
PSMA-expressing LNCap prostate cancer xenografts. All tracers enabled clear

were 8.91 ¡Ó 0.86 and 204 ¡Ó 70.6 for 68Ga-PSMA-11, 16.7 ¡Ó 2.30 and 29.2 ¡Ó 5.14 for

showed comparable tumor uptake, and almost 5-fold higher kidney uptake; whereas
68Ga-HTK01167 exhibited lower tumor and kidney uptake. Compared with
68Ga-PSMA-11, 68Ga-HTK01167 had similar tumor uptake and tumor-to-blood contrast 
ratio (23.8 ¡Ó 6.71 vs 20.4 ¡Ó 4.98) but higher tumor-to-background contrast ratios
for other background organs especially for kidneys. Our data indicate that
substitution of 2-Nal in PSMA-617 with other lipophilic amino acid can modulate
PSMA binding affinity and their pharmacokinetics in vivo.

OBJECTIVE: Pathogenesis and progression of liver cancer are correlated with
inflammatory response and estrogen level. 17£]-estradiol dehydrogenase IV
(HSD17B4) is highly expressed in human liver cancer tissues. HSD17B4 participates
in liver cancer cell proliferation via suppressing estradiol (E2) activity. This 
study generated a rat liver cancer model, on which the correlations between
HSD17B4 and tumor necrosis factor-£\ (TNF-£\), interleukin-6 (IL-6), proliferating 
cell nucleus antigen (PCNA) expression were analyzed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into 
control and model group (N=30). Diethylnitrosamine was used to induce liver
cancer in a rat model. HE staining was used to observe liver injury whilst ELISA 
was used to measure serum TNF-£\ and IL-6 levels. The level of serum E2 was
quantified by radioimmunoassay. Serum liver function indexes were measured by
automatic biochemical analyzer. Protein expressions of HSD17B4, p-Akt, p-ERK and 
PCNA were measured by Western blot.
RESULTS: The inflammatory infiltration and necrosis of hepatocytes were shown in 
model group by HE staining, along with aggravated liver indexes. Significantly
high phosphorylation level of Akt and ERK, along with the increase of HSD17B3 and
PCNA expressions, was found in model group (p<0.05 compared to control group).
Serum E2 level was statistically decreased, whilst TNF-£\ and IL-6 were
up-regulated (p<0.05). HSD17B4 was positively correlated with TNF-£\, IL-6 and
PCNA expressions (r=0.68, 0.62 and 0.56, p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: HSD17B4 is over-expressed in rat liver cancer tissues. Its
expression was positively correlated with TNF-£\, IL-6 and PCNA levels, and
probably participates in liver cancer cell proliferation via ERK and Akt signal
pathway.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether miR-374b can promote the differentiation of
MSCs into osteoblasts by mediating PTEN, thus promoting fracture healing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary cultured mouse mesenchymal stem cells were
obtained for following experiments. Flow cytometry was used to determine the
expression of MSCs surface antigens to identify the purity. Alizarin red staining
was used to detect whether MSCs could differentiate into osteoblasts. QRT-PCR was
used to detect the expression of osteogenic marker genes as well as miR-374b and 
PTEN in bone marrow-derived MSCs from fractured mice model. ALP activity
detection kit was used to detect ALP activity in cells. Changes of osteogenic
proteins in cells were evaluated by Western blot. Bioinformatics methods were
used to predict the binding sites between miR-374 and target genes. Luciferase
reporter assay was used to confirm whether miR-374 could bind to the target gene.
RESULTS: Under normal culture, MSCs grew into a long fusiform shape on the 4th
day. After induced in the osteogenic induction medium for seven days, calcified
nodules appeared. The results of the detection of MSCs surface antigen markers
showed that CD90 was 99.12%, and CD45 was 0.23%. Alizarin red staining showed
that MSCs possess the ability to differentiate into osteogenic. The expression
level of MiR-374b and PTEN increased significantly in the early stage of fracture
in mice, but no significant difference was observed at a later stage. After
overexpression of miR-374b, the cell ALP activity, the expression of
osteogenesis-related genes and osteogenesis-related proteins was significantly
increased, while after knocking out miR-374b, the opposite result was observed.
The result of luciferase reporting assay showed that miR-374b can bind to PTEN.
As mentioned above, overexpression of miR-374b resulted in upregulation of
osteogenic-related genes and proteins, while over-expression of both PTEN and
miR-374b could partly reverse the outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-374b can promote osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by degrading
PTEN, thereby promoting fracture healing.

Erythropoietin?producing hepatocellular carcinoma cell surface type?A receptor?3 
(EPHA3) has been found to promote the proliferation and survival of prostate
cancer (PCa) cell lines and prostate tumor development in nude mice. However, the
regulation of EPHA3 in PCa remains largely unknown. This study is aimed to
investigate the association between EPHA3 expression and androgen receptor (AR)
signaling and the potential mechanism. We determined mRNA and protein levels of
EPHA3 and AR signaling?related genes in the PCa cell line 22Rv1 by reverse
transcription?polymerase chain reaction (RT?PCR) and western blotting,
respectively. The EPHA3 mRNA and protein levels were both found to be elevated by
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) hormone in a dose? and time?dependent manner, as AR and
prostate?specific antigen (PSA) expression were increased. Similarly, EPHA3
protein levels were also increased in the PCa cell line LNCaP stimulated with DHT
or mibolerone (Mib). Overexpression of pEGFP?AR in 22Rv1 cells significantly
increased the EphA3 level, while AR knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA) 
for AR (siAR) markedly decreased the expression of EPHA3. The key EPHA3 promoter 
region associated with AR regulation was evaluated by co?transfection of various 
pGL3?basic?luciferase reporter plasmids, containing EPHA3 core promoter fragments
differing in length, with the AR plasmid or siAR into 22Rv1 cells. AR
overexpression in 22Rvl cells raised the EphA3 promoter transcription activity of
pGL3?EPHA3?Luc (EPHA3?Luc)?789, and vice versa. Similarly, luciferase activity of
EPHA3?Luc?317 was also clearly affected. However, truncated EPHA3?Luc?237 without
the transcription factor specific protein 1 (SP1) binding sites or
EPHA3?Luc?789£GSP1 with modified SP1 binding sites clearly decreased EPHA3
promoter activity regardless of whether AR was overexpressed or blocked.
Treatment of 22Rv1 cells with 10 and 100?nM of the SP1 inhibitor mithramycin?A
for 24 and 48?h significantly reduced EPHA3 mRNA and protein levels.
Additionally, selective inhibition of SP1 with siRNA SP1 (siSP1) at various
concentration from 25 to 75?nM, reduced the EPHA3 protein level in PCa LNCaP
cells, accordingly. Co?immunoprecipitation (co?IP) and chromatin IP (ChIP) assays
were performed to determine whether AR forms a transcription factor complex with 
Sp1 that binds the EPHA3 core promoter region to sense androgen induction. The
result suggests that the interaction of AR and SP1 contributes to regulate EPHA3 
expression, and the SP1 binding sites (?295~?261) in the EPHA3 core promoter
region is crucial to the regulation of EPHA3 expression in response to androgen
hormone stimuli.

(5)Palestinian Ministry of Health, Ramallah, Palestine.

Background: Introducing childhood immunization poses challenges in environments
of societal fragility. The Palestinian territories (Pt) are considered 'fragile' 
because of their lack of political, economic and territorial sovereignty. Poverty
is rife, infant mortality high, and diseases associated with overcrowding
widespread. Under these circumstances the Rostropovich Vishneskaya Foundation
(RVF) has assembled a network of public and private stakeholders to introduce a
country-wide rotavirus immunization program.
Methods: The incidence of diarrhea was determined for 18 months before and 18
months after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine among all children younger
than 5 years presenting to outpatient clinics in Gaza with three or more loose
stools per day. Simultaneously the prevalence of rotavirus was established by
rotavirus antigen detection in stool samples collected from children younger than
3 years at Caritas Baby Hospital in Bethlehem during the corresponding time
periods.
Results: Within 12 months 97.4% immunization coverage was achieved. The incidence
of diarrhea dropped by 32.2%, while the prevalence of rotavirus in stool samples 
decreased by 64.6% throughout the following year.
Conclusion: In environments of economic or political instability private-public
partnerships for the introduction of comprehensive vaccination programs can work 
based on close collaboration, shared vision, flexibility and inter-organizational
trust.

Aims: The generation of homogeneous cardiomyocyte populations from fresh tissue
or stem cells is laborious and costly. A potential solution to this problem would
be to establish lines of immortalized cardiomyocytes. However, as proliferation
and (terminal) differentiation of cardiomyocytes are mutually exclusive
processes, their permanent immortalization causes loss of electrical and
mechanical functions. We therefore aimed at developing conditionally immortalized
atrial myocyte (iAM) lines allowing toggling between proliferative and
contractile phenotypes by a single-component change in culture medium
composition.
Methods and results: Freshly isolated neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes (AMs)
were transduced with a lentiviral vector conferring doxycycline-controlled
expression of simian virus 40 large T antigen. Under proliferative conditions
(i.e. in the presence of doxycycline), the resulting cells lost most
cardiomyocyte traits and doubled every 38?hours. Under differentiation conditions
(i.e. in the absence of doxycycline), the cells stopped dividing and
spontaneously reacquired a phenotype very similar to that of primary AMs in gene 
expression profile, sarcomeric organization, contractile behaviour, electrical
properties and response to ion channel-modulating compounds (as assessed by
patch-clamp and optical voltage mapping). Moreover, differentiated iAMs had much 
narrower action potentials and propagated them at?>?10-fold higher speeds than
the widely used murine atrial HL-1 cells. High-frequency electrical stimulation
of confluent monolayers of differentiated iAMs resulted in reentrant conduction
resembling atrial fibrillation, which could be terminated by tertiapin treatment,
just like in monolayers of primary AMs.
Conclusion: Through controlled expansion and differentiation of AMs, large
numbers of functional cardiomyocytes were generated with properties superior to
the differentiated progeny of existing cardiomyocyte lines. iAMs provide an
attractive new model system for studying cardiomyocyte proliferation,
differentiation, metabolism and (electro)physiology and to investigate cardiac
diseases and drug responses, without using animals.

BACKGROUND: Donor specific HLA antibodies (DSA) are associated with increased
rates of rejection and of graft failure in cardiac transplantation. The goal of
this study was to determine the association of preformed and posttransplant
development of newly detected DSA (ndDSA) with antibody mediated rejection (AMR) 
and characterize the clinical relevance of complement activating DSA in heart
allograft recipients.
METHODS: The study included 128 adult and 48 pediatric heart transplant patients 
transplanted between 2010 to 2013. Routine posttransplant HLA antibody testing
was performed by IgG-Single Antigen Bead (SAB) test. The C3d-SAB assay was used
to identify complement activating antibodies. Rejection was diagnosed using ISHLT
criteria.
RESULTS: In this study, 22 patients were transplanted with preexisting DSA, and
43 patients developed ndDSA posttransplant. Pretransplant (p<0.05) and
posttransplant (p<0.001) ndDSA were associated with higher incidence of AMR.
Patients with C3d+DSA had significantly higher incidence of AMR compared to
patients with no DSA (p<0.001) or patients with C3d-DSA (p=0.02). Nine out of 25 
(36%) patients with AMR developed transplant coronary artery disease (TCAD)
compared to 17/107 (15.9%) patients without AMR (p<0.05). Among the 47 patients
who received ventricular assistant device (VAD), 7/9 VAD+ patients with preformed
DSA experienced AMR compared to 7/38 VAD+ patients without preformed DSA,
indicating presensitization to donor HLA significantly increased the risk of AMR 
(p<0.015).
CONCLUSION: Preformed and posttransplant ndDSA were associated with AMR. C3d+DSA 
correlates with complement deposition on the graft and higher risk of AMR which
may permit the application of personalized immunotherapy targeting the complement
pathway.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the role of Tc-MIP-1404 (Progenics Pharmaceuticals,
Inc, New York, NY) SPECT/CT of PSMA expression in the assessment of treatment
response in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT scans from 28 patients 
with metastatic prostate cancer examined before initiation and after completion
of therapy. Eight of these patients had been treated with androgen deprivation
therapy, 10 with docetaxel, and another 10 with external beam radiotherapy. On
the CT images from SPECT/CT, treatment response was assessed according to RECIST 
1.1 criteria; independently from that analysis, maximal standardized uptake
values (SUVmax) were quantified in representative tumor lesions and treatment
response assumed at differences in SUVmax greater than 30%. Radiographic response
assessment was correlated to biochemical response (BR) based on prostate-specific
antigen serum levels.
RESULTS: The concordance rate between SPECT and BR was 75% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.55-0.89) (Cohen £e = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.29-0.85; P ? 0.01), higher
than for that between SPECT and CT with 57% (95% CI, 0.37-0.76) (£e = 0.40; 95%
CI, 0.14-0.65; P ? 0.01), as well as that between CT and BR with 50% (95% CI,
0.31-0.69) (£e = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.06-0.57, P ? 0.05). Discordant findings between
SPECT and CT were most likely due to limitations of CT in assessing metastases in
lymph nodes, as well as bone involvement, which was sometimes not detectable on
CT scans.
CONCLUSIONS: The high agreement between treatment response, as assessed by
Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT and BR, suggests a possible role of that imaging tool for
monitoring treatment in metastatic prostate cancer. Larger, ideally prospective
trials are needed to help to reveal the full potential of SPECT imaging of PSMA
expression in that regard.

PURPOSE OF THE REPORT: The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the
detection rate of Ga-PSMA PET/CT in biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate
cancer and its impact on patient management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with BCR after curatively intended treatment of
prostate cancer were included. Each patient underwent a Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Changes
in patient management based on the results of Ga-PSMA PET/CT were assessed.
RESULTS: Seventy patients were included. Sixty-four patients (91%) had radical
prostatectomy, of whom 17 patients (24%) received salvage radiation therapy due
to first biochemical relapse. Six patients (9%) underwent radiation therapy as
the primary treatment. Ga-PSMA PET/CT detected recurrent disease in 37 patients
(53%). The detection rate was 22% for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels up
to 0.5 ng/mL compared with 83% for PSA levels greater than 0.5 ng/mL.
Pathological uptake of Ga-PSMA was observed in 4 (16%) of 21, 4 (44%) of 9, 0 of 
1, 7 (70%) of 10, and 22 (88%) of 25 patients with PSA levels from 0.2 to 0.3
ng/mL, 0.31 to 0.4 ng/mL, 0.41 to 0.5 ng/mL, 0.51 to 1 ng/mL, and greater than 1 
ng/mL, respectively. Prostate-specific antigen was significantly higher in
PSMA-positive patients than in PSMA-negative patients. In 15 (22%) of 69
patients, the results caused a definite change in patient management, and in
another 15 (22%) of 69 patients, Ga-PSMA PET/CT guided the choice of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Ga-PSMA PET/CT detects lesions in a large proportion of patients
with BCR. Detection rates at low PSA levels (<0.5 ng/mL) were notably below the
values reported in previous retrospective studies; however, detection rates
improved with increasing PSA levels.

PURPOSE: The recently developed Medical Maximizer-Minimizer Scale (MMS) assesses 
individual differences in preferences for active v. passive medical treatment. We
hypothesized that men's maximizing-minimizing preferences might have relevance in
the case of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, since there is
considerable variability in men's preference for being screened even among men
who are informed that harm is more likely than benefit. The current research
examined whether MMS preferences predict how men respond to didactic information 
and narrative stories about PSA screening.
DESIGN: US men 40+ years old ( N = 1208) participated in an online survey. Men
viewed information about PSA screening in 3 phases and provided their preference 
for screening after each phase. Phase 1 described what PSA screening is. Phase 2 
added didactic information about screening risks and benefits. Phase 3 added
narrative stories; men were randomized to receive stories about 1) physical harm,
2) emotional harm, 3) overdiagnosis, or 4) all 3 stories. Participants also
completed the validated MMS.
RESULTS: After receiving basic information, 76.8% of men wanted PSA screening.
After receiving information about risks and benefits, 54.8% wanted screening (a
significant reduction, P < 0.001). Men who changed their preferences were
significantly more likely to be minimizers than maximizers; most men with
maximizing tendencies wanted screening after both the didactic information and
narratives, whereas most men with minimizing tendencies did not want the test
after receiving information.
CONCLUSIONS: Men who prefer a more minimizing approach to medicine are more
responsive to evidence supporting limiting or forgoing screening than men who
prefer a maximizing approach.

Antigen recognition by single-domain antibodies: structural latitudes and
constraints.

Single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), the autonomous variable domains of heavy
chain-only antibodies produced naturally by camelid ungulates and cartilaginous
fishes, have evolved to bind antigen using only three complementarity-determining
region (CDR) loops rather than the six present in conventional VH:VL antibodies. 
It has been suggested, based on limited evidence, that sdAbs may adopt paratope
structures that predispose them to preferential recognition of recessed protein
epitopes, but poor or non-recognition of protuberant epitopes and small
molecules. Here, we comprehensively surveyed the evidence in support of this
hypothesis. We found some support for a global structural difference in the
paratope shapes of sdAbs compared with those of conventional antibodies: sdAb
paratopes have smaller molecular surface areas and diameters, more commonly have 
non-canonical CDR1 and CDR2 structures, and have elongated CDR3 length
distributions, but have similar amino acid compositions and are no more extended 
(interatomic distance measured from CDR base to tip) than conventional antibody
paratopes. Comparison of X-ray crystal structures of sdAbs and conventional
antibodies in complex with cognate antigens shows that sdAbs and conventional
antibodies bury similar solvent-exposed surface areas on proteins and form
similar types of non-covalent interactions, although these are more concentrated 
in the compact sdAb paratope. Thus, sdAbs likely have privileged access to
distinct antigenic regions on proteins, but only owing to their small molecular
size and not to general differences in molecular recognition mechanism. The
evidence surrounding the purported inability of sdAbs to bind small molecules was
less clear. The available data provide a structural framework for understanding
the evolutionary emergence and function of autonomous heavy chain-only
antibodies.

Augmenting vaccine immunogenicity through the use of natural human anti-rhamnose 
antibodies.

Hossain MK, Vartak A, Karmakar P, Sucheck SJ, Wall KA.

Utilizing natural antibodies to augment vaccine immunogenicity is a promising
approach towards cancer immunotherapy. Anti-rhamnose (anti-Rha) antibodies are
some of the most common natural anti-carbohydrate antibodies present in human
serum. Therefore, rhamnose can be utilized as a targeting moiety for a
rhamnose-containing vaccine to prepare an effective vaccine formulation. It was
shown previously that anti-Rha antibody generated in mice binds effectively with 
Rha-conjugated vaccine and is picked up by antigen presenting cells (APCs)
through stimulatory Fc receptors. This leads to the effective uptake and
processing of antigen and eventually presentation by major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) molecules. In this article, we show that natural human anti-Rha
antibodies can also be used in a similar mechanism and immunogenicity can be
enhanced by targeting Rha-conjugated antigens. In doing so, we have purified
human anti-Rha antibody from human serum using a rhamnose affinity column. In
vitro, human anti-Rha antibodies are shown to enhance the uptake of a model
antigen, Rha-ovalbumin (Rha-Ova), by APCs. In-vivo, they improved the priming of 
CD4+ T cells to Rha-Ova in comparison to non-anti-Rha human antibodies.
Additionally, increased priming of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells towards the cancer 
antigen MUC1-Tn was observed in mice that received human anti-Rha antibodies
prior to vaccination with a rhamnose-modified MUC1-Tn cancer vaccine. The vaccine
conjugate contained Pam3CysSK4, a Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist linked via
copper-free cycloaddition chemistry to a 20-amino-acid glycopeptide derived from 
the tumor marker MUC-1 containing the tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen
£\-N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc). The primed CD8+ T cells released IFN-£^ and
killed tumor cells. Therefore, we have confirmed that human anti-Rha antibodies
can be effectively utilized as a targeting moiety for making an effective
vaccine.

Quenching electrochemiluminescence immunosensor based on resonance energy
transfer between ruthenium (II) complex incorporated in UiO-67 metal-organic
framework and gold nanoparticles for insulin detection.

Zhao G, Wang Y, Li X, Dong X, Wang H, Du B, Cao W, Wei Q.

This work describes a sandwich-type electrochemiluminescence (ECL) strategy for
insulin detection by using Ru(bpy)32+ as luminophore which was encapsulated in
UiO-67 metal-organic framework (UiO-67/Ru(bpy)32+). Since UiO-67 possesses the
characteristics of large specific surface area and porosity, more Ru(bpy)32+
could be loaded onto its surface and holes, thus greatly improving the
electrochemiluminescence efficiency. Furthermore, the ECL resonance energy
transfer (ECL-RET) could occur between UiO-67/Ru(bpy)32+ (ECL donor) and Au@SiO2 
nanoparticles (ECL acceptor), resulting in conspicuously decreased of ECL
response. The ECL spectrum of UiO-67/Ru(bpy)32+ which exhibited strong ECL
intensity has suitable spectral overlap with absorption spectrum of Au@SiO2,
which further proved the occurrence of the ECL-RET action. The ECL intensity
decreased with the increase of the concentration of insulin. In addition, the
sandwich-type ECL immunosensor was applied to insulin detection and the ECL
decrease efficiency was found to be logarithmically related to the concentration 
of the insulin antigen in the range from 0.0025 ng mL-1 to 50 ng mL-1 with the
limit of detection of 0.001 ng mL-1. Meanwhile, this work provides an important
reference for the application of MOFs in ECL and ECL-RET study, and also exhibits
potential capability in the detection of other hormone.

Chronic hepatitis?B virus (HBV) infection remains one of the leading causes of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) globally. However, the mechanism underlying the
mediation by HBV surface proteins (HBsAgs) of the early steps in the virus life
cycle and following HCC development is unclear. £]?2?glycoprotein?I (£]2GPI)
specifically interacts with HBsAg and demonstrates high expression during the
earliest stages of hepatitis?B virus infection. In the present study, the
assessment of HCC and adjacent tissues revealed that the levels of mRNA and
protein of £]2GPI were highly expressed in HBV?related HCC. Previous studies have 
reported that HBsAg activates the nuclear factor (NF)?£eB pathway via interaction 
with £]2GPI in HCC. However, the underlying mechanism of how the interaction
between HBsAg and £]2GPI confers activation of the NF?£eB pathway is still unclear.
The HBsAg is comprised of three carboxyl?co?terminal HB proteins. In the present 
study, immunofluorescence assay and EMSA consistently revealed that a combination
of recombinant small HBV surface antigen (rSHB) and £]2GPI can significantly
activate the NF?£eB signaling pathway. Another study from our team revealed that
high expression of £]2GPI enhanced HBsAg binding to cell surfaces and its
interaction with Annexin II. However, Annexin II is not a transmembrane protein. 
Therefore, by a knockdown experiment with TLR2, TLR4 or MyD88 siRNAs using cells 
with co?incubated HBsAg/£]2GPI, certain aspects of the mechanism through which the
HBsAg/£]2GPI complex activates the NF?£eB pathway through the Toll?like receptor?4 
(TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor?88 (MyD88)/I£eB£\ axis were explained. In the
present study, we identified the functional domain of HBsAg co?interaction with
£]2GPI for the activation of NF?£eB and revealed the mechanism of the
HBsAg/£]2GPI?activated NF?£eB pathway which could contribute to the treatment of
HBV?related HCC. A novel finding of the present study is that HBsAg can bind to
£]2GPI. We first identified the functional domain of HBsAg with £]2GPI to activate 
NF?£eB. Second, by siRNA knockout experiments, we identified the downstream
molecules involved in the activation of NF?£eB induced by £]2GPI/HBsAg. In
addition, we found that HBsAg/£]2GPI activated the NF?£eB pathway through the
phosphorylation of Ser32/36 by I£eB£\.

Background & objectives: Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are major arboviral
vectors that are considered to lay eggs, and undergo preimaginal development only
in fresh water collections. However, recently they have been also shown to
develop in coastal brackish water habitats. The ability of the biologically
variant salinity-tolerant Aedes vectors to transmit arboviral diseases is
unknown. We therefore, investigated the infection of salinity-tolerant Aedes
mosquitoes with dengue virus (DENV) and analysed dengue incidence and rainfall
data to assess the contribution of salinity-tolerant Aedes vectors to dengue
transmission in the coastal Jaffna peninsula in Sri Lanka.
Methods: Brackish and fresh water developing female Ae. aegypti and Ae.
albopictus were tested for their ability to become infected with DENV through in 
vitro blood feeding and then transmit DENV vertically to their progeny. An
immunochromatographic test for the NS1 antigen was used to detect DENV. Temporal 
variation in dengue incidence in relation to rainfall was analysed for the
peninsula and other parts of Sri Lanka.
Results: Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus developing in brackish water, became
infected with DENV through in vitro blood feeding and the infected mosquitoes
were able to vertically transmit DENV to their progeny. Monsoonal rainfall was
the discernible factor responsible for the seasonal increase in dengue incidence 
in the peninsula and elsewhere in Sri Lanka.
Interpretation & conclusion: Fresh water Aedes vectors are main contributors to
the increased dengue incidence that typically follows monsoons in the Jaffna
peninsula and elsewhere in Sri Lanka. It is possible however, that brackish
water-developing Aedes constitute a perennial reservoir for DENV to maintain a
basal level of dengue transmission in coastal areas of the peninsula during the
dry season, and this supports increased transmission when monsoonal rains expand 
populations of fresh water Aedes.

Malaria, caused by the protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, is a major
health problem in many countries of the world. Five parasite species namely,
Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. knowlesi, cause
malaria in humans. Of these, P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most prevalent
and account for the majority of the global malaria cases. In most areas of
Africa, P. vivax infection is essentially absent because of the inherited lack of
Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines on the surface of red blood cells that is
involved in the parasite invasion of erythrocytes. Therefore, in Africa, most
malaria infections are by P. falciparum and the highest burden of P. vivax
infection is in Southeast Asia and South America. Plasmodium falciparum is the
most virulent and as such, it is responsible for the majority of malarial
mortality, particularly in Africa. Although, P. vivax infection has long been
considered to be benign, recent studies have reported life-threatening
consequences, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral malaria,
multi-organ failure, dyserythropoiesis and anaemia. Despite exhibiting low
parasite biomass in infected people due to parasite's specificity to infect only 
reticulocytes, P. vivax infection triggers higher inflammatory responses and
exacerbated clinical symptoms than P. falciparum, such as fever and chills.
Another characteristic feature of P. vivax infection, compared to P. falciparum
infection, is persistence of the parasite as dormant liver-stage hypnozoites,
causing recurrent episodes of malaria. This review article summarizes the
published information on P. vivax epidemiology, drug resistance and
pathophysiology.

An Enzyme-Free Immunosorbent Assay of Prostate Specific Antigen Amplified by
Releasing pH Indicator Molecules Entrapped in Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles.

Shao F, Zhang L, Jiao L, Wang X, Miao L, Li H, Zhou F.

An enzyme-free titer plate-based colorimetric assay utilizing functionalized
mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) entrapping pH-indicator molecules has been
developed. Pores in the silica nanoparticles were functionalized with
phenyltrimethyloxysilane so that pH indicator molecules (thymolphthalein or TP in
the present case) can be tightly entrapped through £k{£k conjugation. To detect
prostate specific antigen (PSA), the TP-containing MSNs were coated with
polyethylenimine (PEI), which favors the attachment of the positively charged
secondary anti-PSA antibody. The entrapped thymolphthalein molecules can be
readily released from the pores with a simple addition of alkaline solution. The 
resultant bifunctional MSNs were used for signal-amplified detection of PSA
captured by the primary antibody pre-immobilized in the wells of a plate. Our
method possesses a wide dynamic range (0.5 to 8000 pg/mL) wherein the adsorption 
of the bifunctional MSNs obeys a modified Langmuir isotherm. A detection limit
(LOD) down to as low as 0.36 pg/mL can be attained. Owing to the size uniformity 
of the MSNs and the obviation of enzyme molecules employed in the enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), excellent reproducibility (RSD = 1.12%) was
achieved. The selective detection of PSA in human serum samples demonstrates the 
amenability of our method to detecting important biomarkers in complex biological
samples, whereas the performance of the assay in a titer plate ensures high
throughputs and obviates the use of expensive instruments. Both of these features
are prerequisites for clinical settings wherein a great number of samples need to
be analyzed in a timely fashion.

Efforts to elucidate mechanisms of regeneration in the planarian Schmidtea
mediterranea have included the application of immunocytochemical methods to
detect specific molecules and label cells and tissues in situ. Here we describe
methods for immunofluorescent labeling of whole mount planarians. We outline
protocols for fixation and steps for processing animals prior to immunolabeling, 
incorporating commonly utilized reagents for mucus removal, pigment bleaching,
tissue permeabilization, and antigen retrieval. Because processing steps can mask
or degrade antigens, we also recommend protocol parameters that can be tested
simultaneously to optimize sample preparation for novel antibodies.

Food allergies affect some 15 million Americans. The only treatment for food
allergies is a strict avoidance diet. To help ensure the reliability of food
labels, analytical methods are employed; the most common being enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). However, the commonly employed ELISAs are single
analyte-specific and cannot distinguish between false positives due to
cross-reactive homologous proteins; making the method of questionable utility for
regulatory purposes when analyzing for unknown or multiple food allergens. Also, 
should the need arise to detect additional analytes, extensive research must be
undertaken to develop new ELISAs. To address these and other limitations, a
multiplex immunoassay, the xMAPR food allergen detection assay (xMAP FADA), was
developed using 30 different antibodies against 14 different food allergens plus 
gluten. Besides incorporating two antibodies for the detection of most analytes, 
the xMAP FADA also relies on two different extraction protocols; providing
multiple confirmatory end-points. Using the xMAP FADA, the cross-reactivities of 
45 botanicals used in dietary supplements and spices commercially sold in the USA
were assessed. Only a few displayed cross-reactivities with the antibodies in the
xMAP FADA at levels exceeding 0.0001%. The utility of the xMAP FADA was
exemplified by its ability to detect and distinguish between betel nut, saw
palmetto, and acai which are in the same family as coconut. Other botanicals
examined included allspice, amchur, anise seed, black pepper, caraway seed,
cardamom, cayenne red pepper, sesame seed, poppy seed, white pepper, and wheat
grass. The combination of direct antibody detection, multi-antibody profiling,
high sensitivity, and a modular design made it possible for the xMAP FADA to
distinguish between homologous antigens, provide multiple levels of built-in
confirmatory analysis, and optimize the bead set cocktail to address specific
needs.

BACKGROUND: Airway fibrin casts are clinically important complications of severe 
inhalational smoke-induced acute lung injury (ISIALI) for which reliable
evidence-based therapy is lacking. Nebulized anticoagulants or a tissue
plasminogen activator; tPA, has been advocated, but airway bleeding is a known
and lethal potential complication. We posited that nebulized delivery of single
chain urokinase plasminogen activator, scuPA, is well-tolerated and improves
physiologic outcomes in ISIALI. To test this hypothesis, we nebulized scuPA or
tPA and delivered these agents every 4?h to sheep with cotton smoke induced
ISIALI that were ventilated by either adaptive pressure ventilation/controlled
mandatory ventilation (APVcmv; Group 1, n?=?14) or synchronized controlled
mandatory ventilation (SCMV)/limited suctioning; Group 2, n?=?32). Physiologic
readouts of acute lung injury included arterial blood gas analyses, PaO2/FiO2
ratios, peak and plateau airway pressures, lung resistance and static lung
compliance. Lung injury was further assessed by histologic scoring. Biochemical
analyses included determination of antigenic and enzymographic uPA and tPA
levels, plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activities
and D-dimer in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Plasma levels of uPA, tPA antigens, 
D-dimers and £\-macroglobulin-uPA complex levels were also assessed.
RESULTS: In Group 1, tPA at the 2?mg dose was ineffective, but at 4?mg tPA or
scuPA, the PaO2/FiO2 ratios, peak/plateau pressures improved during evolving
injury (p?<?0.01) without significant differences at 48?h. To improve delivery of
the interventions, the experiments were repeated in Group 2 with limited
suctioning/SCMV, which generally increased PAs in (BAL). In Group 2, tPA was
ineffective, but scuPA (4 or 8?mg) improved physiologic outcomes (p?<?0.01) and
plateau pressures remained lower at 48?h. Airway bleeding occurred at 8?mg tPA.
BAL plasminogen activator (PA) levels positively correlated with physiologic
outcomes at 48?h.
CONCLUSIONS: Physiologic outcomes improved in sheep in which better delivery of
the PAs occurred. The benefits of nebulized scuPA were achieved without airway
bleeding associated with tPA, but were transient and largely abrogated at 48?h,
in part attributable to the progression and severity of ISIALI.

PURPOSE: Cellular immune dysfunctions, which are common in intensive care
patients, predict a number of significant complications. In order to effectively 
target treatments, clinically applicable measures need to be developed to detect 
dysfunction. The objective was to confirm the ability of cellular markers
associated with immune dysfunction to stratify risk of secondary infection in
critically ill patients.
METHODS: Multi-centre, prospective observational cohort study of critically ill
patients in four UK intensive care units. Serial blood samples were taken, and
three cell surface markers associated with immune cell dysfunction [neutrophil
CD88, monocyte human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) and percentage of regulatory
T?cells (Tregs)] were assayed on-site using standardized flow cytometric
measures. Patients were followed up for the development of secondary infections.
RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were recruited, with data available from 138.
Reduced neutrophil CD88, reduced monocyte HLA-DR and elevated proportions of
Tregs were all associated with subsequent development of infection with odds
ratios (95% CI) of 2.18 (1.00-4.74), 3.44 (1.58-7.47) and 2.41 (1.14-5.11),
respectively. Burden of immune dysfunction predicted a progressive increase in
risk of infection, from 14% for patients with no dysfunction to 59% for patients 
with dysfunction of all three markers. The tests failed to risk stratify patients
shortly after ICU admission but were effective between days 3 and 9.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms our previous findings that three cell surface
markers can predict risk of subsequent secondary infection, demonstrates the
feasibility of standardized multisite flow cytometry and presents a tool which
can be used to target future immunomodulatory therapies.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT02186522).

sensitivity of electrochemical immunoassays as demonstrated for the carbohydrate 
antigen 125 (CA125), a biomarker for ovarian cancer. Compared to previous HCR
based assays, the DNA acting as fuel strands were immobilized onto AuNPs, so that
dendrimeric like chains were formed on the electrode after HCR. The improved
signal is due to the reaction of DNA on the electrode. Specifically, the reaction
of the phosphate groups of DNA with molybdate forms redox-active
molybdophosphate, and this generates a strong electrochemical current. The
immunosensor was prepared by sequential capturing, on the electrode, (a) antibody
against CA125, (b) analyte (CA125), and (c) an aptamer against CA125 to form a
sandwich structure. The primer on the aptamer sequence initiates HCR by annealing
to one strand of DNA on the AuNPs and to another DNA in solution. The increased
loading of DNA molecules onto the electrode increases the amount of phosphate
groups and subsequently increases the electrical signal. The sensitivity of the
assay is found to be significantly improved compared to assays without HCR and
when using conventional HCR. The immunosensor was successfully applied to the
determination of CA125 in human serum samples. The detection limit (based on an
S/N ratio?of 3) is 50 £gU.mL-1. This indicates that this signal amplification
strategy has a large potential in terms of clinical applications. It may be
modified such that it also can be applied to the determination of other analytes 
for which proper aptamers are available. Graphical abstract Gold nanoparticle
(AuNP) enhanced hybridization chain reaction is reported to improve the
sensitivity of electrochemical immunosensor. Hybridization chain reaction is
carried out by annealing of H1 DNA strand immobilized on AuNP to the sticky end
primer sequence of the aptamer and H2 strand to the complementary sequence of H1.

Objective: To determine the prevalence of ABO and Rh blood groups based on the
antigenic presence on the surface of red blood cells with respect to gender and
calculate allele frequency of the blood groups. Globally, approximately 700 type 
red cell antigens have been identified till now. ABO and Rh blood groups play an 
important role in the process of blood transfusion, resolving certain medicolegal
issues, parental testing, and various genetic studies.
Methods: This study was conducted in H.N.B. Base Hospital, Srinagar, Uttarakhand,
from January 2012 to December 2016. Relevant data of blood donors were collected 
from blood bank department of the hospital. Blood grouping was conducted using
commercially available standard monoclonal antisera applying test tube and column
agglutination techniques.
Results: Out of 9883 individuals, 9333 (92.4%) were males and 750 (7.6%) were
female individuals. The most common blood group found was B (31.68%) and least
common being AB (11.70%). The prevalence of Rhesus positive and negative
distribution in the present studied population was found as 93.51% and 6.49%,
respectively. Overall, male ABO group pattern found was shown by formula B > A > 
O > AB which was similar among Rh-positive male individuals while Rh-negative
males' pattern was found as A > B = O > AB. In females, ABO group pattern was B >
O > A > AB which was similar to Rh-positive female pattern while differs in Rh
negative. The estimated allele frequencies were found as 0.2403, 0.2475, and
0.5122 for IA (p), IB (q), and IO (r), respectively.
Conclusion: The most common blood group found among the Gharwali donors was B
positive while the least common was AB negative, which plays an important
contribution for making government policies to develop National Health Program.

Cancer Immunotherapy and the Immune Response in Hodgkin Lymphoma.

Renner C(1), Stenner F(2).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biomedicine, University Basel, Basel, Switzerland.
(2)Department of Oncology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.

Patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) have an impaired cellular immune
response as indicated by an anergic reaction against standard recall antigens and
a diminished rejection reaction of allogeneic skin transplant. This clinical
observation can be linked to the histopathological feature of cHL since the
typical pattern of a cHL manifestation is characterized by sparse large CD30+
tumor-infiltrating Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells that are surrounded by a
dense inflammatory immune microenvironment with mixed cellularity. Despite this
extensive polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate, there is only a poor antitumor
immune response seen to the neoplastic HRS cells. This is primarily mediated by a
high expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands on the HRS cell surface which in turn 
antagonizes the activity of programmed death-1 (PD-1) antigen-positive T cells.
PD-L1/L2 overexpression is caused by gene amplification at the 9p24.1 locus
and/or latent Epstein-Barr virus infection present in around 40% of cHL cases.
The blockade of the PD-L1/L2-PD-1 pathway by monoclonal antibodies can restore
local T cell activity and leads to impressive tumor responses, some of which are 
long lasting and eventually curative. Another feature of HRS cells is the high
CD30 antigen expression. Monoclonal antibody technology allowed for the
successful development of CD30-specific immunotoxins, bispecific antibodies, and 
reprogrammed autologous T cells with the first one already approved for the
treatment of high risk or relapsed cHL. Altogether, the discovery of the
described pathomechanism of immune suppression and the identification of
preferential target antigens has rendered cHL to be a prime subject for the
successful development of new immunotherapeutic approaches.

Cancer immunotherapy, which stimulates or augments host immune responses to treat
malignancies, is the latest development in the rapidly advancing field of cancer 
immunology. The basic principles of immunotherapies are either to enhance the
functions of specific components of the immune system or to neutralize
immune-suppressive signals produced by cancer cells or tumor microenvironment
cells. When successful, these approaches translate into long-term survival for
patients. However, durable responses are only seen in a subset of patients and so
far, only in some cancer types. As for other cancer treatments, resistance to
immunotherapy can also develop. Numerous research groups are trying to understand
why immunotherapy is effective in some patients but not others and to develop
strategies to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. The Notch signaling
pathway is involved in many aspects of tumor biology, from angiogenesis to cancer
stem cell maintenance to tumor immunity. The role of Notch in the development and
modulation of the immune response is complex, involving an intricate crosstalk
between antigen-presenting cells, T-cell subpopulations, cancer cells, and other 
components of the tumor microenvironment. Elegant studies have shown that Notch
is a central mediator of tumor-induced T-cell anergy and that activation of
Notch1 in CD8 T-cells enhances cancer immunotherapy. Tumor-infiltrating myeloid
cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells, altered dendritic cells, and
tumor-associated macrophages along with regulatory T cells, are major obstacles
to the development of successful cancer immunotherapies. In this article, we
focus on the roles of Notch signaling in modulating tumor-infiltrating myeloid
cells and discuss implications for therapeutic strategies that modulate Notch
signaling to enhance cancer immunotherapy.

Vaccine Designs Utilizing Invariant NKT-Licensed Antigen-Presenting Cells Provide
NKT or T Cell Help for B Cell Responses.

Vaccines against a variety of infectious diseases have been developed and tested.
Although there have been some notable successes, most are less than optimal or
have failed outright. There has been discussion about whether either B cells or
dendritic cells (DCs) could be useful for the development of antimicrobial
vaccines with the production of high titers of antibodies. Invariant (i)NKT cells
have direct antimicrobial effects as well as adjuvant activity, and
iNKT-stimulated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) can determine the form of the
ensuing humoral and cellular immune responses. In fact, upon activation by
ligand, iNKT cells can stimulate both B cells and DCs as via either cognate or
non-cognate help. iNKT-licensed DCs generate antigen-specific follicular helper
CD4+ T cells, which in turn stimulate B cells, thus leading to long-term
antigen-specific antibody production. Follicular helper iNKT cell-licensed B
cells generally produce rapid, but short-term antibody. However, under some
conditions in the presence of Th cells, the antibody production can be prolonged.
With regards to humoral immunity, the quality and quantity of Ab produced depends
on the APC type and the form of the vaccine. In terms of cellular immunity and,
in particular, the induction of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, iNKT-licensed DCs show
prominent activity. In this review, we discuss differences in iNKT-stimulated APC
types and the quality of the ensuing immune response, and also discuss their
application in vaccine models to develop successful preventive immunotherapy
against infectious diseases.

Diversity in the Cow Ultralong CDR H3 Antibody Repertoire.

Haakenson JK(1), Huang R(1), Smider VV(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla,
CA, United States.

Typical antibodies found in humans and mice usually have short CDR H3s and
generally flat binding surfaces. However, cows possess a subset of antibodies
with ultralong CDR H3s that can range up to 70 amino acids and form a unique
"stalk and knob" structure, with the knob protruding far out of the antibody
surface, where it has the potential to bind antigens with concave epitopes.
Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) has a proven role in diversifying
antibody repertoires in humoral immunity, and it has been found to induce somatic
hypermutation in bovine immunoglobulin genes both before and after contact with
antigen. Due to limited use of variable and diversity genes in the V(D)J
recombination events that produce ultralong CDR H3 antibodies in cows, the
diversity in the bovine ultralong antibody repertoire has been proposed to rely
on AID-induced mutations targeted to the IGHD8-2 gene that encodes the entire
knob region. In this review, we discuss the genetics, structures, and diversity
of bovine ultralong antibodies, as well as the role of AID in creating a diverse 
antibody repertoire.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are key antigen-presenting cells that control the induction
of both tolerance and immunity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating
DCs commitment toward a regulatory- or effector-inducing profile is critical for 
better designing prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. Initially identified in
dexamethasone-treated thymocytes, the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper
(GILZ) protein has emerged as a critical factor mediating most, but not all,
glucocorticoids effects in both non-immune and immune cells. This intracellular
protein exerts pleiotropic effects through interactions with transcription
factors and signaling proteins, thus modulating signal transduction and gene
expression. GILZ has been reported to control the proliferation, survival, and
differentiation of lymphocytes, while its expression confers anti-inflammatory
phenotype to monocytes and macrophages. In the past twelve years, a growing set
of data has also established that GILZ expression in DCs is a molecular switch
controlling their T-cell-priming capacity. Here, after a brief presentation of
GILZ isoforms and functions, we summarize current knowledge regarding GILZ
expression and regulation in DCs, in both health and disease. We further present 
the functional consequences of GILZ expression on DCs capacity to prime effector 
or regulatory T-cell responses and highlight recent findings pointing to a
broader role of GILZ in the fine tuning of antigen capture, processing, and
presentation by DCs. Finally, we discuss future prospects regarding the possible 
roles for GILZ in the control of DCs function in the steady state and in the
context of infections and chronic pathologies.

CD4+ regulatory T cells have been intensively studied during aging, but little is
still known about age-related changes of other regulatory T cell subsets. It was,
therefore, the goal of the present study to analyze CD8+human leukocyte
antigen-antigen D related (HLADR)+ T cells in old age, a cell population reported
to have suppressive activity and to be connected to specific genetic variants. We
demonstrate a strong increase in the number of CD8+HLADR+ T cells with age in a
cohort of female Sardinians as well as in elderly male and female persons from
Austria. We also show that CD8+HLADR+ T cells lack classical activation
molecules, such as CD69 and CD25, but contain increased numbers of checkpoint
inhibitory molecules, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, T cell
immunoglobulin and mucin protein-3, LAG-3, and PD-1, when compared with their
HLADR- counterparts. They also have the capacity to inhibit the proliferation of 
autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This suppressive activity is,
however, decreased when CD8+HLADR+ T cells from elderly persons are analyzed. In 
accordance with this finding, CD8+HLADR+ T cells from persons of old age contain 
lower percentages of checkpoint inhibitory molecules than young controls. We
conclude that in spite of high abundance of a CD8+ regulatory T cell subset in
old age its expression of checkpoint inhibitory molecules and its suppressive
function on a per cell basis are reduced. Reduction of suppressive capacity may
support uncontrolled subclinical inflammatory processes referred to as
"inflamm-aging."

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a potentially life-threatening mucocutaneous
autoimmune blistering disease. Patients develop non-healing erosions and blisters
due to cell-cell detachment of keratinocytes (acantholysis), with subsequent
suprabasal intraepidermal splitting. Identified almost 30?years ago, desmoglein-3
(Dsg3), a Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion molecule belonging to the cadherin family,
has been considered the "primary" autoantigen in PV. Proteomic studies have
identified numerous autoantibodies in patients with PV that have known roles in
the physiology and cell adhesion of keratinocytes. Antibodies to these
autoantibodies include desmocollins 1 and 3, several muscarinic and nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor subtypes, mitochondrial proteins, human leukocyte antigen 
molecules, thyroid peroxidase, and hSPCA1-the Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase encoded by ATP2C1,
which is mutated in Hailey-Hailey disease. Several studies have identified direct
pathogenic roles of these proteins, or synergistic roles when combined with Dsg3.
We review the role of these direct and indirect mechanisms of non-desmoglein
autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of PV.

Recently, the effects of stem cell supernatants or exosomes, such as skin wounds,
have attracted attention. However, the effects of the induced pluripotent stem
(iPS) cell-derived exosomes (iPS-Exos) have not been investigated in detail.
Here, we investigated the effects of iPS-Exos on skin wound healing using an
animal model. We isolated iPS-Exos from the iPS cell culture media. Control
exosomes were isolated from unused iPS cell culture media (M-Exos). We first
observed the morphologic characteristics of the isolated exosomes and examined
the expression of surface antigens. The effects of these exosomes on the
migratory response and proliferation of fibroblasts were analyzed as well.
Additionally, using a diabetic ulcer model, the effects of iPS-Exos and M-Exos on
skin wound healing were investigated. Transmission electron microscope analysis
demonstrated that the size of iPS-Exos (120 ¡Ó 25 nm) was significantly larger
than that of M-Exos (? 100 nm). Flow cytometry analyses showed that iPS-Exos were
positive for CD9, CD63, and CD81, whereas they were negative for HLA-ABC and -DR 
expression. The migratory ability of fibroblasts cocultured with iPS-Exos was
shown to be higher than that of the cells cocultured with M-Exos, as demonstrated
using scratch assay. Skin wound healing model results showed that the
administration of iPS-Exos results in a faster wound closure compared with that
observed in the M-Exo group. In conclusion, the results obtained here indicate
that iPS-Exos may promote the migration of fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo,
suggesting the possibility of using iPS-Exos for the treatment of diabetic ulcer.

Substantial evidence shows that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in
many biological mechanisms, and their dysregulation are also involved in the
development and progression of cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). Long
intergenic non-coding RNA 00324 (LINC00324), a 2115?bp ncRNA, is located on
chromosome 17p13.1. The biological function and molecular mechanisms of LINC00324
in GC remains undiscovered. In this paper, we found that the expression level of 
LINC00324 was significantly upregulated in GC tissues compared with the
corresponding normal tissues. The overexpression of LINC00324 was correlated with
advanced TNM stage, larger tumor size, and lymph node metastasis as well as poor 
prognosis. Further experiments revealed that knockdown of LINC00324 could
suppress the proliferation of GC cells. RNA transcriptome sequencing technology
revealed that FAM83B may be a significant downstream target gene of LINC00324.
LINC00324 could combine with the RNA-binding protein (RBP) human antigen R (HuR) 
and thus stabilize the expression of FAM83B. Moreover, rescue assays showed that 
the reduced FAM83B expression partially reversed the promotion of cell growth in 
GC induced by the overexpression of LINC00324. In conclusion, our study revealed 
that LINC00324 acted as an oncogene in tumorigenesis and progression, suggesting 
that it could be a new biomarker in diagnosis and prognosis of GC.

T cell-antigen receptor (TCR) signaling requires the sequential activities of the
kinases Lck and Zap70. Upon TCR stimulation, Lck phosphorylates the TCR, thus
leading to the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of Zap70. Lck binds
and stabilizes phosho-Zap70 by using its SH2 domain, and Zap70 phosphorylates the
critical adaptors LAT and SLP76, which coordinate downstream signaling. It is
unclear whether phosphorylation of these adaptors occurs through passive
diffusion or active recruitment. We report the discovery of a conserved
proline-rich motif in LAT that mediates efficient LAT phosphorylation. Lck
associates with this motif via its SH3 domain, and with phospho-Zap70 via its SH2
domain, thereby acting as a molecular bridge that facilitates the colocalization 
of Zap70 and LAT. Elimination of this proline-rich motif compromises TCR
signaling and T cell development. These results demonstrate the remarkable
multifunctionality of Lck, wherein each of its domains has evolved to orchestrate
a distinct step in TCR signaling.

Antitumor T-cell responses have the potential to be curative in cancer patients, 
but the induction of potent T-cell immunity through vaccination remains a largely
unmet goal of immunotherapy. We previously reported that the immunogenicity of
peptide vaccines could be increased by maximizing delivery to lymph nodes (LNs), 
where T-cell responses are generated. This was achieved by conjugating the
peptide to 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-PEG (DSPE-PEG) to
promote albumin binding, which resulted in enhanced lymphatic drainage and
improved T-cell responses. Here, we expanded upon these findings and
mechanistically dissected the properties that contribute to the potency of this
amphiphile-vaccine (amph-vaccine). We found that multiple linkage chemistries
could be used to link peptides with DSPE-PEG, and further, that multiple
albumin-binding moieties conjugated to peptide antigens enhanced LN accumulation 
and subsequent T-cell priming. In addition to enhancing lymphatic trafficking,
DSPE-PEG conjugation increased the stability of peptides in serum.
DSPE-PEG-peptides trafficked beyond immediate draining LNs to reach distal nodes,
with antigen presented for at least a week in vivo, whereas soluble peptide
presentation quickly decayed. Responses to amph-vaccines were not altered in mice
deficient in the albumin-binding neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), but required
Batf3-dependent dendritic cells (DCs). Amph-peptides were processed by human DCs 
equivalently to unmodified peptides. These data define design criteria for
enhancing the immunogenicity of molecular vaccines to guide the design of
next-generation peptide vaccines.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic disorder initiated by
antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin complexes. PF4 released from
platelets binds to surface glycosaminoglycans on hematopoietic and vascular cells
that are heterogenous in composition and differ in affinity for PF4. PF4 binds to
monocytes with higher affinity than to platelets, and depletion of monocytes
exacerbates thrombocytopenia in a murine HIT model. Here we show that the
expression of PF4 on platelets and development of thrombocytopenia are modulated 
by the (re)distribution of PF4 among hematopoietic and endothelial cell surfaces.
Binding of PF4 to platelets in whole blood in vitro varies inversely with the
white cell count, likely due to the greater affinity of monocytes for PF4. In
mice, monocyte depletion increased binding of PF4 to platelets two-three fold.
Induction of HIT in mice caused a transient >80-fold increase in binding of HIT
antibody to monocytes versus 3.5-fold increase to platelets, and rapid, transient
monocytopenia. Normalization of monocyte counts preceded the return in platelet
counts. Exposure of blood to endothelial cells also depletes PF4 from platelet
surfaces. These studies demonstrate a dynamic interchange of surface-bound PF4
among hematopoetic and vascular cells that may limit thrombocytopenia at the
expense of promoting prothrombotic processes in HIT.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells demonstrate efficacy in B-cell
malignancies, leading to FDA approval of axicaptagene ciloleucel in October 2017 
and tisagenlecleucel in May 2018 for large B-cell lymphomas after two prior lines
of therapy. Durable remissions are seen in 30-40% of study-treated patients, but 
unique toxicities of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity require
administration in specialized centers. This article reviews the data to-date
within the context of current diffuse large B-cell lymphoma management, focusing 
on axicaptagene ciloleucel, tisagenlecleucel and lisocabtagene maraleucel.

Human T cells that recognize lipid Ags presented by highly conserved CD1 proteins
often express semi-invariant TCRs, but the true diversity of lipid Ag-specific
TCRs remains unknown. We use CD1b tetramers and high-throughput immunosequencing 
to analyze thousands of TCRs from ex vivo-sorted or in vitro-expanded T cells
specific for the mycobacterial lipid Ag, glucose monomycolate. Our results reveal
a surprisingly diverse repertoire resulting from editing of germline-encoded gene
rearrangements analogous to MHC-restricted TCRs. We used a distance-based metric 
(TCRDist) to show how this diverse TCR repertoire builds upon previously reported
conserved motifs by including subject-specific TCRs. In a South African cohort,
we show that TCRDist can identify clonal expansion of diverse glucose
monomycolate-specific TCRs and accurately distinguish patients with active
tuberculosis from control subjects. These data suggest that similar mechanisms
govern the selection and expansion of peptide and lipid Ag-specific T cells
despite the nonpolymorphic nature of CD1.

Gonorrhea, an important sexually transmitted disease, is becoming a growing
public health problem around the globe. Vaccination is considered the best
long-term approach for control of infection. In this study, we designed a novel
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) DNA vaccine delivered by bacterial ghosts 
and characterized its immune responses in vitro and in vivo. Our results
demonstrate that bacterial ghosts greatly promoted BMDCs maturation and
activation. Bacterial ghosts loaded with N. gonorrhoeae DNA vaccine were
efficiently taken up by mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, oral
immunization with the ghost vaccine candidate elicited greater CD4+ and CD8+ T
cell responses and induced higher IgG responses than N. gonorrhoeae DNA vaccine
alone. In addition, mice immunized with the vaccine candidate responded with a
significant rise in bactericidal antibody titer. These results suggest that
bacterial ghosts may function as a vaccine adjuvant by promoting BMDCs
maturation, which in turn enhances the immune responses to the vaccine antigens. 
This study also highlights the potential of using bacterial ghosts as antigen
delivery system in the development of an efficacious gonorrhea vaccine.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the Alphacoronaviridae
genus within the Coronaviridae family. It is the causative agent of porcine
epidemic diarrhea, a disease that can have mortality rates as high as 100% in
suckling piglets. PEDV causes severe economic loss, and has been in existence for
decades. A panzootic starting in 2010 renewed interest in the development of a
universal vaccine toward PEDV. This report details several design changes made to
a Hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg)-based recombinant vaccine strategy, and 
their effect in vivo. Initially, several multi-antigen vaccine candidates were
able to elicit antibodies specific to three out of four B-cell epitopes inserted 
into the chimeric proteins. However, a lack of virus neutralization led to a
redesign of the vaccines. The focus of the newly redesigned vaccines was to
elicit a strong immune response to the YSNIGVCK amino acid motif from PEDV.
Genetically modified new vaccine candidates were able to elicit a strong antibody
(Ab) response to the YSNIGVCK epitope, which correlated with an increased ability
to neutralize the CO strain of PEDV. Additionally, the location of the inserted
PEDV epitopes within the vector protein was shown to affect the immune
recognition toward the native HBcAg during vaccination.

BACKGROUND: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma is one of the deadliest central
nervous system tumours of childhood, with a median overall survival of less than 
12 months. Convection-enhanced delivery has been proposed as a means to
efficiently deliver therapeutic agents directly into the brainstem while
minimising systemic exposure and associated toxic effects. We did this study to
evaluate the safety of convection-enhanced delivery of a radioimmunotherapy agent
targeting the glioma-associated B7-H3 antigen in children with diffuse intrinsic 
pontine glioma.
METHODS: We did a phase 1, single-arm, single-centre, dose-escalation study at
the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA). Eligible patients
were aged 3-21 years and had diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma as diagnosed by
consensus of a multidisciplinary paediatric neuro-oncology team; a Lansky
(patients <16 years of age) or Karnofsky (patients ?16 years) performance score
of at least 50 at study entry; a minimum weight of 8 kg; and had completed
external beam radiation therapy (54¡P0-59¡P4 Gy at 1¡P8 Gy per fraction over 30-33
fractions) at least 4 weeks but no more than 14 weeks before enrolment. Seven
dose-escalation cohorts were planned based on standard 3?+?3 rules: patients
received a single infusion of 9¡P25, 18¡P5, 27¡P75, 37, 92¡P5, 120¡P25, or 148 MBq,
respectively, at a concentration of about 37 MBq/mL by convection-enhanced
delivery of the radiolabelled antibody [124I]-8H9. The primary endpoint was
identification of the maximum tolerated dose. The analysis of the primary
endpoint was done in the per-protocol population (patients who received the full 
planned dose of treatment), and all patients who received any dose of study
treatment were included in the safety analysis. This study is registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01502917, and is ongoing with an expanded cohort.
FINDINGS: From April 5, 2012, to Oct 8, 2016, 28 children were enrolled and
treated in the trial, of whom 25 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. The
maximum tolerated dose was not reached as no dose-limiting toxicities were
observed. One (4%) of 28 patients had treatment-related transient grade 3
hemiparesis and one (4%) had grade 3 skin infection. No treatment-related grade 4
adverse events or deaths occurred. Estimated volumes of distribution (Vd) were
linearly dependent on volumes of infusion (Vi) and ranged from 1¡P5 to 20¡P1 cm3,
with a mean Vd/Vi ratio of 3¡P4 (SD 1¡P2). The mean lesion absorbed dose was 0¡P39
Gy/MBq 124I (SD 0¡P20). Systemic exposure was negligible, with an average
lesion-to-whole body ratio of radiation absorbed dose higher than 1200.
INTERPRETATION: Convection-enhanced delivery in the brainstem of children with
diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma who have previously received radiation therapy
seems to be a rational and safe therapeutic strategy. PET-based dosimetry of the 
radiolabelled antibody [124I]-8H9 validated the principle of using
convection-enhanced delivery in the brain to achieve high intra-lesional dosing
with negligible systemic exposure. This therapeutic strategy warrants further
development for children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.

Chlamydia trachomatis infection (chlamydia) is the most prevalent sexually
transmitted bacterial infection and causes significant reproductive morbidity in 
women. Little is known about how immunity to chlamydia develops in women, though 
animal models of chlamydia indicate that T-helper type 1 (Th1) responses are
important for chlamydia clearance and protective immunity, whereas T-helper type 
2 (Th2) responses are associated with persisting infection. In chlamydia-infected
women, whether the predominant immune response is Th1- or Th2-polarizing remains 
controversial. To determine the cytokine profiles elicited by peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from chlamydia-infected women, we stimulated PBMCs with
C. trachomatis elementary bodies and recombinant C. trachomatis Pgp3 and measured
supernatant levels of select cytokines spanning Th1- and Th2-polarizing
responses. We found that stimulated PBMCs from chlamydia-infected women secreted 
cytokines that indicate strong Th1-polarizing responses, especially
interferon-gamma, whereas Th2-polarizing cytokines were expressed at
significantly lower levels. In chlamydia-infected women, the predominant cytokine
responses elicited on stimulation of PBMCs with C. trachomatis antigens were
Th1-polarizing, with interferon-gamma as the predominant cytokine.

Feline histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is an aggressive and uncommon tumor originating
from dendritic cells/macrophages. Here, a feline HS cell line, FHS-1, was
established from a case of feline HS and characterized. Immunohistochemically,
FHS-1 cells were positive for vimentin and Iba-1, and negative for MHC class II
and CD163. FHS-1 cells were positive for £\-naphthyl butyrate esterase staining,
which was clearly inhibited by sodium fluoride. FHS-1 cells had phagocytic and
antigen uptake/processing activities. Moreover, FHS-1 cells were tested for
susceptibility to feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79-1146;
however, this cell line was not susceptible to this viral strain. Although FHS-1 
cells lost the expression of MHC class II and CD163, our findings indicate that
FHS-1 is a feline HS cell line that retains functional properties of dendritic
cells/macrophages in terms of phagocytic and antigen uptake/processing
activities. While FHS-1 cells are not suitable for in vitro study of FIP using
strain 79-1146, they may be applicable for studies aimed at developing new
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for feline HS.

Recurrent inflammation in severe equine asthma causes a remodeling of the airways
leading to incompletely reversible airway obstruction. Despite the improvement of
clinical signs and lung function with glucocorticoids (GC), inflammation,
translated by an increased percentage of neutrophils, persists in the airways.
Regulatory T cells (Treg) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties
and play an important role in balancing the immune response by suppressing
effector lymphocyte activity. However, interactions between Treg, neutrophils and
glucocorticosteroids in vivo are unclear, particularly in asthma. Furthermore,
the effects of GC on Treg in the airway of asthmatic horses have not been
investigated. We hypothesized that horses with severe asthma display a decreased 
population of pulmonary Treg when compared to heathy controls, and that treatment
with GC lead to an increased pulmonary Treg cell population only in affected
horses. Using lung function measurements and flow cytometry with surface antigens
CD4 and FoxP3, we investigated Treg in airway luminal cells obtained by
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 6 asthmatic horses in exacerbation of
the disease and 6 aged-match controls, kept in the same environment, before and
following a 2-week treatment with dexamethasone. Results showed that the number
of Treg increases only in the lungs of asthmatic horses following GC therapy,
despite continued presence of increased numbers of neutrophils. Our results
support the complexity of the interaction between Treg, neutrophils and GC.

Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is endemic in several areas of South Africa and has
been reported in multiple species, including common warthogs (Phacochoerus
africanus). Limited diagnostic tests and disease control programs exist for
African wildlife. Thus, there is a need to develop techniques for bTB detection
in species such as warthogs to assess their role in disease maintenance and
spread in multi-host ecosystems. In this study, we obtained blood samples from
warthogs in bTB endemic areas to investigate biomarkers for detection of
Mycobacterium bovis infection. Warthog whole blood was incubated in QuantiFERONR 
TB Gold In-Tube tubes and pathogen specific release of interferon gamma (IFN-£^)
and interferon gamma induced protein 10 (IP-10) was measured by a sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although we were unable to measure IFN-£^, we
could successfully measure IP-10. The IP-10 assay was able to distinguish between
M. bovis-infected and M. bovis-culture negative warthogs, within bTB endemic
areas, with an assay specific sensitivity of 68% and specificity of 84%. Of the
88 M. bovis-exposed warthogs screened, 42% were IP-10 test positive. These
results indicate warthogs develop a measurable cell-mediated immune response
after antigen stimulation of whole blood, which can distinguish between M.
bovis-infected and M. bovis-culture negative animals. Thus, the IP-10 assay shows
promise as an ante-mortem test to diagnose bTB in warthogs.

Effective disease management of wildlife relies on the strategic application of
ante-mortem diagnostic tests for early identification and removal of M.
bovis-infected animals. To improve diagnostic performance, interferon-gamma
release assays (IGRAs) are often used in conjunction with the tuberculin skin
test (TST). Since buffaloes are major maintenance hosts of M. bovis, optimal
application of bovine TB diagnostic tests are especially important. We aimed to
determine whether the timing of blood collection relative to the TST has an
influence on IFN-£^ production and diagnostic outcome in African buffaloes.
Release of IFN-£^ in response to bovine purified protein derivative (PPD), avian
PPD and PC-HPR and PC-ECR peptides was measured by BovigamR and an in-house IGRA 
in a group of BovigamR-positive and - negative buffaloes at the time the TST was 
performed and three days later. There was significantly lower IFN-£^ release in
response to these antigens post-TST in BovigamR-positive buffaloes, but no
significant changes in BovigamR-negative buffaloes. Also, a significantly greater
proportion of buffaloes were BovigamR-positive prior to the TST than three days
later. We therefore recommend that blood samples for use in IGRAs be collected
prior to or at the time the TST is performed to facilitate the correct
identification of greater numbers of IGRA-positive buffaloes.

BACKGROUND: Chinese woodchucks (M. himalayana) were recently found to be
susceptible to woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection. In this study, we aimed
to determine the susceptibility to WHV infection of M. himalayana from different 
areas and their association with the animal genetic background exemplified by
cytochrome B and MHC-DRB molecules.
METHODS: Animals from four different areas in Qinghai province were inoculated
with WHV59 strains. The virological markers including WHV surface antigen
(WHsAg), WHV core antibody (WHcAb), and WHV DNA in serum were measured by ELISA
and Real-time PCR, respectively. The sequences of cytochrome B gene and MHC-DRB
molecules were obtained and sorted with Clustalx software. The nucleotide
variation sites were identified using MEGA5 software.
RESULTS: The animals from four different areas had different susceptibility to
WHV infection. Animals from TR and TD areas had a high level of long-lasting
viremia, while those from GD and WL areas had a low level of transient viremia
after WHV inoculation. All of the animals belong to the same subspecies M.
himalayana robusta identified by cytochrome B gene sequences. Based on their
nucleotide variation pattern, 8 alleles of cytochrome B gene were identified, and
7 MHC-DRB alleles were identified. Allele A of cytochrome B and Allele
Mamo-DRB1*02 of MHC-DRB was found to be frequent in animals from TR and TD areas,
while Allele H of cytochrome B and Allele Mamo-DRB1*07 of MHC-DRB was predominant
in animals from GD and WL areas.
CONCLUSION: Chinese woodchucks from different areas differed in their
susceptibility to WHV infection, though they belong to the same subspecies M.
himalayana robusta. The genetic background exemplified by cytochrome B and
MHC-DRB differed in Chinese woodchucks with different susceptibility to WHV
infection.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a world health problem with an
estimated 257 million chronically infected people. Indonesia, with 7.1%
prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), is classified as a moderately 
endemic country. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high occupational risk for HBV 
infection and potentially becoming transmitters for further infections. In
Indonesia, the extent of hepatitis B among HCWs and specific control strategy are
not available. This study evaluated the seroprevalence of HBV infection and
associated risk factors in HCWs from four areas in South Sulawesi, Indonesia.
METHODS: A total of 467 HCWs (median age 28?years, male/female 89/378) were
recruited. All HCWs were classified into three age groups (<?20-29, 30-39,
and???40?years old), three work types (administration, non-intervention, and
intervention), and three service periods (<?5, 5-9, and???10?years). Data on
socio-demographic characteristics and risk factors were obtained by questionnaire
and serum samples were tested for HBV markers (HBsAg, its antibody [anti-HBs],
and antibody to core antigen [anti-HBc]. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test was
used to determine differences in categorical variables, while risk factors were
reported as odds ratios (OR).
RESULTS: The prevalence of current HBV infection (HBsAg+), exposure to HBV
(anti-HBc+), and immunity to HBV (anti-HBs+) was 6.2, 19.2, and 26.1%,
respectively. Two thirds (66.17%) of all HCWs did not express any of HBV markers.
In relation to the age groups, intervention work-type, and service period of
HCWs, increasing trends were observed in the exposure to HBV (p?<?0.001,
p?<?0.001, and p?<?0.010, respectively) and the immunity to HBV by natural
infection (HBsAg-, anti-HBc+, anti-HBs+) (p?=?0.004, p?<?0.001, and p?<?0.010,
respectively). Needlestick injury contributed the highest risk factor (OR?=?1.71;
95% CI: 1.05-2.77; p?=?0.029) for infection acquisition, which mostly occurred in
the intervention group (p?=?0.046).
CONCLUSION: Exposure to HBV showed significant association with HCWs' age, work
type, and service period. Needlestick injury was the highest risk factor for the 
acquisition of HBV, with highest events in the intervention work-type. Two thirds
of HCWs were still susceptible to HBV infection. Intervention strategies at the
national level are required to mount prevention, control, and management of HBV
infection in HCWs.

Deprotection-induced morphology transition and immuno-activation of
glyco-vesicles: a strategy of smart delivery polymersomes.

Qi W, Zhang Y, Wang J, Tao G, Wu L, Kochovski Z, Gao H, Chen G, Jiang M.

We proposed the deprotection-induced block copolymer self-assembly (DISA), that
is, the deprotection of hydroxyl groups resulted in in situ self-assembly of
glycopolymers. In the previous studies, block copolymers soluble in common
organic solvents were employed as the starting material. In this paper, by using 
the protected glyco-block containing pre-assembled glyco-vesicles in water as the
starting material, we moved forward and made two exceeding achievements. Firstly,
we have observed a deprotection-induced morphology transition trigged by alkali
in water. The carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction was considered to contribute 
to such a morphology transition during deprotection. Secondly, lipase was found
to be an efficient enzymatic trigger in the sugar deprotection, which motivates
the immune-application of this morphology transition process. When lipase and a
model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), were encapsulated inside the glyco-vesicles, the 
deprotection of sugars by lipase induced the transition of vesi-cles to micelles 
and the lipase and OVA were released accordingly. When glyco-vesicles were
internalized by dentritic cells (DCs), the lipase from lysosomes efficiently
induced the release of OVA and presentation of antigen to T cells. During the
process, lyso-somal lipase performed as a trigger on the deprotection of sugars
and the release of protein without any other reagents. The signifi-cance of this 
design is that as a delivery vehicle, the protected glyco-vesicles not only
avoided unnecessary immune activation, but also worked with the released OVA
together, i.e. the glyco-vehicle successfully activated DCs and improved
presentation efficiency of T cells remarkably.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally.
While genomic alterations have been identified in PCa, in contrast to some other 
cancers, use of such information to personalize treatment is still in its
infancy. Here, we discuss how PAGE4, a protein which appears to act both as an
oncogenic factor as well as a metastasis suppressor, is a novel therapeutic
target for PCa. Inhibiting PAGE4 may be a viable strategy for low-risk PCa where 
it is highly upregulated. Conversely, PAGE4 expression is downregulated in
metastatic PCa and, therefore, reinstituting its sustained expression may be a
promising option to subvert or attenuate androgen-resistant PCa. Thus,
fine-tuning the levels of PAGE4 may represent a novel approach for personalized
medicine in PCa.

The adenylate cyclase toxin-hemolysin (CyaA, ACT, or AC-Hly) plays a crucial role
in virulence and airway colonization capacity of the whooping cough agent
Bordetella pertussis. The toxin penetrates target cell membranes and exhibits
three distinct biological activities. A population of CyaA conformers forms small
cation-selective pores that permeabilize the cell membrane for potassium efflux, 
which can provoke colloid-osmotic (oncotic) cell lysis. The other two activities 
are due to CyaA conformers that transiently form calcium influx conduits in the
target cell membrane and translocate the adenylate cyclase (AC) enzyme into
cytosol of cells. A fourth putative biological activity has recently been
reported; an intrinsic phospholipase A (PLA) activity was claimed to be
associated with the CyaA polypeptide and be involved in the mechanism of
translocation of the AC enzyme polypeptide across cell membrane lipid bilayer.
However, the conclusions drawn by the authors contradicted their own results and 
we show them to be erroneous. We demonstrate that highly purified CyaA is devoid 
of any detectable phospholipase A1 activity and that contrary to the published
claims, the two putative conserved phospholipase A catalytic residues, namely the
Ser606 and Asp1079 residues, are not involved in the process of membrane
translocation of the AC domain of CyaA across target membranes.

Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) infection induces robust CD8 T cell responses, which 
play a critical role in resolving Lm during primary infection and provide
protective immunity to re-infections. Comprehensive studies have been conducted
to delineate the CD8 T cell response after Lm infection. In this review, the
generation of the CD8 T cell response to Lm infection will be discussed. The role
of dendritic cell subsets in acquiring and presenting Lm antigens to CD8 T cells 
and the events that occur during T cell priming and activation will be addressed.
CD8 T cell expansion, differentiation and contraction as well as the signals that
regulate these processes during Lm infection will be explored. Finally, the
formation of memory CD8 T cell subsets in the circulation and in the intestine
will be analyzed. Recently, the study of CD8 T cell responses to Lm infection has
begun to shift focus from the intravenous infection model to a natural oral
infection model as the humanized mouse and murinized Lm have become readily
available. Recent findings in the generation of CD8 T cell responses to oral
infection using murinized Lm will be explored throughout the review. Finally, CD8
T cell-mediated protective immunity against Lm infection and the use of Lm as a
vaccine vector for cancer immunotherapy will be highlighted. Overall, this review
will provide detailed knowledge on the biology of CD8 T cell responses after Lm
infection that may shed light on improving rational vaccine design.

Since cells in solid tumors divide less rapidly than cells in the bone marrow or 
cells of the immune system, mitotic inhibitors often cause severe side effects
when used for treatment of diseases like prostate cancer and breast cancer. One
approach to overcome this problem involves attempts at developing drugs based on 
general cytotoxins, like calicheamicin and thapsigargin, which kill cells at all 
phases of the cell cycle. However, such toxins can only be used when efficient
targeting to the malignant tissue is possible. In the case of thapsigargin,
selectivity for tumor-associated cells is achieved by conjugating the drug to a
peptide that is only cleaved in the vicinity of tumors to release the cytotoxic
drug or an analog with retained activity. Solid-phase synthesis protocols were
developed for preparation of three already validated prodrugs of thapsigargin:
one prodrug cleavable by human kallikrein 2, one prodrug cleavable by
prostate-specific antigen, and one prodrug cleavable by prostate-specific
membrane antigen.

In this work, a sensitive electrochemical immunosensor has been reported for the 
determination of norfloxacin in animal-derived foods. The poly (amidoamine)
dendrimer encapsulated gold nanoparticles (PAMAM-Au) played dual roles in the
proposed sensing platform which not only accelerated the electron transfer
process of sensing, but also increased the efficiency of the immobilized
antibody. The HRP-labeled antigen, as the signal labels in the immunosensor, was 
introduced to catalyze the following reaction of the substrate hydroquinone with 
the aid of H?O? in the competitive reaction. On the basis of the signal
amplification of PAMAM-Au, the signal intensity was linearly related to the
concentration of norfloxacin in the range of 1 &mu;g&middot;L&minus;1?10
mg&middot;L&minus;1. All the results showed that the proposed strategy with low
LOD (0.3837 &mu;g&middot;L&minus;1) and favorable recovery (91.6?106.1%) in the
practical sample, and it could provide a suitable protocol for norfloxacin
detection in animal-derived foods with high sensitivity, good accuracy, and
stability.

Currently licensed glycoconjugate vaccines are composed of a carbohydrate moiety 
covalently linked to a protein carrier. Polysaccharides are T-cell independent
antigens able to directly stimulate B cells to produce antibodies. Disease burden
caused by polysaccharide-encapsulated bacteria is highest in the first year of
life, where plain polysaccharides are not generally immunogenic, limiting their
use as vaccines. This limitation has been overcome by covalent coupling
carbohydrate antigens to proteins that provide T cell epitopes. In addition to
the protein carriers currently used in licensed glycoconjugate vaccines, there is
a search for new protein carriers driven by several considerations: (i) concerns 
that pre-exposure or co-exposure to a given carrier can lead to immune
interference and reduction of the anti-carbohydrate immune response; (ii)
increasing interest to explore the dual role of proteins as carrier and
protective antigen; and (iii) new ways to present carbohydrates antigens to the
immune system. Protein carriers can be directly coupled to activated glycans or
derivatized to introduce functional groups for subsequent conjugation. Proteins
can be genetically modified to pre-determine the site of glycans attachment by
insertion of unnatural amino acids bearing specific functional groups, or
glycosylation consensus sequences for in vivo expression of the glycoconjugate. A
large portion of the new protein carriers under investigation are recombinant
ones, but more complex systems such as Outer Membrane Vesicles and other
nanoparticles are being investigated. Selection criteria for new protein carriers
are based on several aspects including safety, manufacturability, stability,
reactivity toward conjugation, and preclinical evidence of immunogenicity of
corresponding glycoconjugates. Characterization panels of protein carriers
include tests before conjugation, after derivatization when applicable, and after
conjugation. Glycoconjugate vaccines based on non-covalent association of carrier
systems to carbohydrates are being investigated with promising results in animal 
models. The ability of these systems to convert T-independent carbohydrate
antigens into T-dependent ones, in comparison to traditional glycoconjugates,
needs to be assessed in humans.

Neuropathic pain conditions are common after nerve injuries and are suggested to 
be regulated in part by genetic factors. We have previously demonstrated a strong
genetic influence of the rat major histocompatibility complex on development of
neuropathic pain behavior after peripheral nerve injury. In order to study if the
corresponding human leukocyte antigen complex (HLA) also influences
susceptibility to pain, we performed an association study in patients that had
undergone surgery for inguinal hernia (n = 189). One group had developed a
chronic pain state following the surgical procedure, while the control group had 
undergone the same type of operation, without any persistent pain. HLA
DRB1genotyping revealed a significantly increased proportion of patients in the
pain group carrying DRB1(*)04 compared to patients in the pain-free group.
Additional typing of the DQB1 gene further strengthened the association; carriers
of the DQB1(*)03:02 allele together with DRB1(*)04 displayed an increased risk of
postsurgery pain with an odds risk of 3.16 (1.61-6.22) compared to noncarriers.
This finding was subsequently replicated in the clinical material of patients
with lumbar disc herniation (n = 258), where carriers of the DQB1(*)03:02 allele 
displayed a slower recovery and increased pain. In conclusion, we here for the
first time demonstrate that there is an HLA-dependent risk of developing pain
after surgery or lumbar disc herniation; mediated by the DRB1(*)04-DQB1(*)03:02
haplotype. Further experimental and clinical studies are needed to fine-map the
HLA effect and to address underlying mechanisms.

mAbs have emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer. However,
in several malignancies, no effective antitumor mAbs are yet available.
Identifying therapeutic mAbs that recognize common tumor antigens could render
the treatment widely applicable. Here, a human single-chain variable fragment
(scFv) antibody library was sequentially affinity selected against a panel of
human cancer cell lines and an antibody fragment (named MS5) that bound to solid 
and blood cancer cells was identified. The MS5 scFv was fused to the human IgG1
Fc domain to generate an antibody (MS5-Fc fusion) that induced antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages. In
addition, the MS5-Fc antibody bound to primary leukemia cells and induced
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In the majority of analyzed cancer
cells, the MS5-Fc antibody induced cell surface redistribution of the receptor
complexes, but not internalization, thus maximizing the accessibility of the IgG1
Fc domain to immune effector cells. In vitro stability studies showed that the
MS5-Fc antibody was stable after 6 d of incubation in human serum, retaining ?60%
of its initial intact form. After intravenous injections, the antibody localized 
into tumor tissues and inhibited the growth of 3 different human tumor xenografts
(breast, lymphoma, and leukemia). These antitumor effects were associated with
tumor infiltration by macrophages and NK cells. In the Ramos B-cell lymphoma
xenograft model, the MS5-Fc antibody exhibited a comparable antitumor effect as
rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 IgG1 mAb. These results indicate that human
antibodies with pan-cancer abilities can be generated from phage display
libraries, and that the engineered MS5-Fc antibody could be an attractive agent
for further clinical investigation.-Sioud, M., Westby, P., Vasovic, V., Floisand,

A tripartite cancer vaccine candidate, containing a quaternary amino acid
(£\-methylserine) in the most immunogenic domain of MUC1, has been synthesized and
examined for antigenic properties in transgenic mice. The vaccine which is
glycosylated with GalNAc at the unnatural amino acid, was capable of eliciting
potent antibody responses recognizing both glycosylated and unglycosylated
tumour-associated MUC1 peptides and native MUC1 antigen present on cancer cells. 
The peptide backbone of the novel vaccine presents the bioactive conformation in 
solution and is more resistant to enzymatic degradation than the natural counter 
part. In spite of these features, the immune response elicited by the unnatural
vaccine was not improved compared to a vaccine candidate containing natural
threonine. These observations were rationalized by conformational studies,
indicating that the presentation and dynamics of the sugar moiety displayed by
the MUC1 derivative play a critical role in immune recognition. It is clear that 
engineered MUC1-based vaccines bearing unnatural amino acids have to be able to
emulate the conformational properties of the glycosidic linkage between the
GalNAc and the threonine residues. The results described here will be helpful to 
the rational design of efficacious cancer vaccines.

An increased von Willebrand factor propeptide (VWFpp) to VWF antigen (VWF:Ag)
ratio (VWFpp/VWF:Ag) indicates an enhanced clearance of VWF. This finding has
been described in von Willebrand disease (VWD) and in acquired von Willebrand
syndrome (AVWS). A distinction between these two diseases, one congenital and the
other acquired, is primarily based on family and personal history of bleeding.
However, if this information is scanty, the diagnosis might be challenging due to
the lack of an effective diagnostic biomarker. In this cross-sectional study, we 
assessed the ability of VWFpp/VWF:Ag for the differential diagnosis between VWD
and AVWS. VWFpp/VWF:Ag was measured in a group of 153 patients (125 with VWD and 
28 with AVWS). Most patients with AVWS and VWD showed an increased VWFpp/VWF:Ag, 
although to variable degrees. A marked increase of VWFpp/VWF:Ag was mainly
associated with the diagnosis of AVWS and VWD type 1 Vicenza. A receiver
operating characteristic curve was used to identify the optimal cutoff of
VWFpp/VWF:Ag for discrimination of patients with a modestly increased (most VWD
cases) versus those with a markedly increased clearance (AVWS and VWD type 1
Vicenza), and this cutoff was identified at the value of 3.9 (sensitivity: 0.70, 
specificity: 0.97). The ROC curve sorting from a logistic model containing
VWFpp/VWF:Ag, age, and sex had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95%
confidence interval: 0.80-0.95). A subsequent molecular evaluation discriminated 
VWD type 1 Vicenza from AVWS. In conclusion, VWFpp/VWF:Ag appears helpful to
discriminate patients with a markedly increase VWF clearance (AVWS or VWD type 1 
Vicenza) from those with a modestly increased clearance (most VWD patients).

Despite a wide number of toxicological studies that describe benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)
effects, the metabolic mechanisms that underlie these effects in fish are largely
unknown. Of great concern is the presence of BaP in aquatic systems, especially
those in close proximity to human activity leading to consumption of potentially 
contaminated foods. BaP is a known carcinogen and it has been reported to have
adverse effects on the survival, development and reproduction of fish. The
purpose of this study was to investigate if a low dose of BaP can alter genes and
key metabolic pathways in the liver and testis in male adult tilapia, and whether
these could be associated with biological endpoints disruption. We used both
high-throughput RNA-Sequencing to assess whole genome gene expression following
repeated intraperitoneal injections of 3?mg/kg of BaP (every 6 days for 26 days) 
and morphometric endpoints as indicators of general health. Condition factor (K) 
along with hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices (morphometric parameters) were
significantly lower in BaP-treated fish than in controls. BaP exposure induced
important changes in the gene expression pattern in liver and testis as revealed 
by both Pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses. Alterations that were shared by 
both tissues included arachidonic acid metabolism, androgen receptor to
prostate-specific antigen signaling, and insulin-associated effects on
lipogenesis. The most salient liver-specific effects included: biological
processes involved in detoxification, IL6-associated insulin resistance, mTOR
hyperactivation, mitotic cytokinesis, spindle pole and microtubule binding. BaP
effects that were confined to the testis included: immune system functions,
inflammatory response, estrogen and androgen metabolic pathways. Taken together, 
gene expression and morphometric end point data indicate that the reproductive
success of adult male tilapia could be compromised as a result of BaP exposure.
These results constitute new insights on the mechanism of action of low dose BaP 
in a non-model organism (tilapia).

Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the etiological agent of enzootic bovine leukosis 
(EBL), which causes enormous economic losses in the livestock industry worldwide.
To reduce the economic loss caused by BLV infection, it is important to clarify
the characters associated with BLV transmissibility and pathogenesis in cattle.
In this study, we focused on viral characters and examined spontaneous mutations 
in the virus and viral properties by analyses of whole genome sequences and BLV
molecular clones derived from cows with and without EBL. Genomic analysis
indicated that all 28 strains harbored limited genetic variations but no deletion
mutations that allowed classification into three groups (A, B, and C), except for
one strain. Some nucleotide/amino acid substitutions were specific to a
particular group. On the other hand, these genetic variations were not associated
with the host bovine leukocyte antigen-DRB3 allele, which is known to be related 
to BLV pathogenesis. The viral replication activity in vitro was high, moderate, 
and low in groups A, B, and C, respectively. In addition, the proviral load,
which is related to BLV transmissibility and pathogenesis, was high in cows
infected with group A strains and low in those infected with group B/C strains.
Therefore, these results suggest that limited genetic variations could affect
viral properties relating to BLV transmissibility and pathogenesis.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a complex autoimmune disorder characterised by 
loss of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells in genetically predisposed
individuals, ultimately resulting in insulin deficiency and hyperglycaemia. T1D
is most common among children and young adults, and the incidence is on the rise 
across the world. The aetiology of T1D is hypothesized to involve genetic and
environmental factors that result in the T-cell mediated destruction of
pancreatic beta cells. There is a strong genetic risk to T1D; with genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) identifying over 60 susceptibility regions within the 
human genome which are marked by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here, we
review what is currently known about the genetics of T1D. We argue that advancing
our understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of T1D will require the
integration of genome biology (omics-data) with GWAS data, thereby making it
possible to elucidate the putative gene regulatory networks modulated by
disease-associated SNPs. This approach has a potential to revolutionize clinical 
management of T1D in an era of precision medicine.

BACKGROUND: False positive HIV screening tests in pregnancy may lead to
unnecessary interventions in labor. In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention released a new algorithm for HIV diagnosis using a 4th generation
screening test, which detects antibodies to HIV as well as p24 antigen and has a 
shorter window period compared with prior generations. A reactive screen requires
a differentiation assay, and supplemental qualitative RNA testing is necessary
for nonreactive differentiation assay. One screening test, the ARCHITECT Ag/Ab
Combo assay, is described to have 100% sensitivity and >99% specificity in
non-pregnant populations; however, its clinical performance in pregnancy has not 
been well described.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the performance of the ARCHITECT assay among pregnant
women at a large county hospital and to assess if the relative signal-to-cutoff
ratio can be used to differentiate between false positive versus confirmed HIV
infections in women with nonreactive differentiation assay.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective review of 4th generation HIV testing in
pregnant women at Parkland Hospital between June 1, 2015 and January 31, 2017. We
identified gravidas screened using the ARCHITECT Ag/Ab Combo assay (index test), 
with reflex to differentiation assay. Women with reactive ARCHITECT and
nonreactive differentiation assay were evaluated with a qualitative RNA assay
(reference standard). We calculated sensitivity, specificity, predictive value,
and false positive rate of the ARCHITECT screening assay in our population, and
described characteristics of women with false positive HIV testing versus
confirmed infection. Among women with nonreactive differentiation assay, we
compared interventions among women with and without qualitative RNA assay result 
available at delivery, and examined relative signal-to-cutoff ratios of the
ARCHITECT assay in women with false positive versus confirmed HIV infection.
RESULTS: A total of 21,163 pregnant women were screened using the ARCHITECT
assay, and 190 tested positive. Of these, 33/190 (17%) women had false positive
HIV screening tests (28 deliveries available for analysis), and 157/190 (83%) had
confirmed HIV-1 infection (140 available for analysis). Diagnostic accuracy of
the ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo assay in our prenatal population (with 95%CI) was
as follows: sensitivity 100%(97.7%-100%), specificity 99.8%(99.8%-99.9%),
positive likelihood ratio 636(453-895), negative likelihood ratio 0.0(NA),
positive predictive value 83%(77%-88%), and false positive rate
0.16%(0.11%-0.22%), with prevalence 7/1,000. Women with false positive HIV
testing were younger and more likely of Hispanic ethnicity. Qualitative RNA assay
(reference standard) was performed prenatally in 24(86%) and quantitative viral
load in 22(92%). Interventions occurred more frequently in women without
qualitative RNA assay result available at delivery, including intrapartum
zidovudine (75% vs 4%, p=0.002), breastfeeding delay (75% vs 8%, p=0.001) and
neonatal zidovudine initiation (75% vs 4%, p=0.002). ARCHITECT signal-to-cutoff
ratio was significantly lower for women with false positive HIV tests compared to
those with established HIV infection (1.89 [1.27, 2.73] vs 533.65 [391.12,
737.22], respectively, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: While the performance of the 4th generation ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo
assay among pregnant women is comparable to that reported in non-pregnant
populations, clinical implications of using a screening test with positive
predictive value of 83% in pregnancy are significant. When qualitative RNA assay 
result is unavailable, absence of risk factors in combination with ARCHITECT HIV 
Ag/Ab assay S/Co ratio <5 and nonreactive differentiation assay provide
sufficient evidence to support deferral of unnecessary intrapartum interventions 
while awaiting qualitative RNA results.

Metal-based nanoparticles (NPs) stimulate innate immunity; however, they have
never been demonstrated to be capable of aiding the generation of specific
cellular immune responses. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate whether iron 
oxide-based NPs have adjuvant properties in generating cellular Th1, Th17 and
TCD8 (Tc1) immune responses. For this purpose, a fusion protein (CMX) composed of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens was used as a subunit vaccine. Citrate-coated
MnFe2O4 NPs were synthesized by co-precipitation and evaluated by transmission
electron microscopy. The vaccine was formulated by homogenizing NPs with the
recombinant protein, and protein corona formation was determined by dynamic light
scattering and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The vaccine was
evaluated for the best immunization route and strategy using subcutaneous and
intranasal routes with 21-day intervals between immunizations. When administered 
subcutaneously, the vaccine generated specific CD4+IFN-£^+ (Th1) and CD8+IFN-£^+
responses. Intranasal vaccination induced specific Th1, Th17 (CD4+IL-17+) and Tc1
responses, mainly in the lungs. Finally, a mixed vaccination strategy (2
subcutaneous injections followed by one intranasal vaccination) induced a Th1 (in
the spleen and lungs) and splenic Tc1 response but was not capable of inducing a 
Th17 response in the lungs. This study shows for the first time a subunit vaccine
with iron oxide based NPs as an adjuvant that generated cellular immune responses
(Th1, Th17 and TCD8), thereby exhibiting good adjuvant qualities. Additionally,
the immune response generated by the subcutaneous administration of the vaccine
diminished the bacterial load of Mtb challenged animals, showing the potential
for further improvement as a vaccine against tuberculosis.

Immunogenicity data from phase 1 vaccine studies can be difficult to interpret,
especially in seropositive populations and when multiple assays are used. We
developed 3 statistical methods (Youden index [YI] threshold, receiver-operating 
characteristic relative to baseline [ROC-B], and ROC of postdose levels [ROC-P]) 
to characterize complex immunogenicity data by assessing the proportion of a
study population that achieved values above thresholds. The YI method calculates 
a single threshold per assay. Both ROC methods construct ROC curves for
individual assays and surfaces for assay combinations to assess degree of
separation of postdose values from a reference distribution; the ROC-B method
uses overall predose values as the reference distribution and the ROC-P method
uses pooled postdose values. All methods are applicable to a seropositive
population with overlapping distributions of baseline and postdose measurements
and can evaluate results of multiple assays jointly. The ROC-P method is also
applicable when postdose levels are fully separated from baseline levels, as is
common in a seronegative population. These methods were demonstrated using data
from a phase 1a study of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines formulated with and
without an adjuvant in a seropositive population of adults aged ?60?years. All 3 
methods provided a comprehensive assessment of vaccine immunogenicity effects
with results presented in easily interpretable formats. In the example data, the 
methods demonstrated antigen dose response trend and contribution of adjuvant to 
response in multiple assays individually and jointly where optimal responses in
assay combinations (humoral and cellular) are important.

Accommodation refers to a condition in which a transplant (or any tissue) appears
to resist immune-mediated injury and loss of function. Accommodation was
discovered and has been explored most thoroughly in ABO-incompatible kidney
transplantation. In this setting, kidney transplants bearing blood group A or B
antigens often are found to function normally in recipients who lack and hence
produce antibodies directed against the corresponding antigens. Whether
accommodation is owed to changes in anti-blood group antibodies, changes in
antigen or a change in the response of the transplant to antibody binding are
critically reviewed and a new working model that allows for the kinetics of
development of accommodation is put forth. Regardless of how accommodation
develops, observations on the fate of ABO-incompatible transplants offer lessons 
applicable more broadly in transplantation and in other fields.

Does human leukocyte antigens sensitization matter for xenotransplantation?

The major histocompatibility complex class I and class II human leukocyte
antigens (HLA) play a central role in adaptive immunity but are also the dominant
polymorphic proteins targeted in allograft rejection. Sensitized patients with
high levels of panel-reactive anti-HLA antibody (PRA) are at risk of early
allograft injury, rejection, reduced allograft survival and often experience
prolonged waiting times prior to transplantation. Xenotransplantation, using
genetically modified porcine organs, offers a unique source of donor organs for
these highly sensitized patients if the anti-HLA antibody, which places the
allograft at risk, does not also enhance anti-pig antibody reactivity responsible
for xenograft rejection. Recent improvements in xenotransplantation efficacy have
occurred due to improved immune suppression, identification of additional
xenogeneic glycans, and continued improvements in donor pig genetic modification.
Genetically engineered pig cells, devoid of the known xenogeneic glycans,
minimize human antibody reactivity in 90% of human serum samples. For waitlisted 
patients, early comparisons of patient PRA and anti-pig antibody reactivity found
no correlation suggesting that patients with high PRA levels were not at
increased risk of xenograft rejection. Subsequent studies have found that some,
but not all, highly sensitized patients express anti-HLA class I antibody which
cross-reacts with swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) class I proteins. Recent detailed
antigen-specific analysis suggests that porcine-specific anti-SLA antibody from
sensitized patients binds cross-reactive groups present in a limited subset of
HLA antigens. This suggests that using modern genetic methods, a program to
eliminate specific SLA alleles through donor genetic engineering or stringent
donor selection is possible to minimize recipient antibody reactivity even for
highly sensitized individuals.

Differentiating dengue patients from other acute febrile illness patients is a
great challenge among physicians. Several dengue diagnosis methods are
recommended by WHO. The application of specific laboratory tests is still limited
due to high cost, lack of equipment, and uncertain validity. Therefore, clinical 
diagnosis remains a common practice especially in resource limited settings.
Bayesian networks have been shown to be a useful tool for diagnostic decision
support. This study aimed to construct Bayesian network models using basic
demographic, clinical, and laboratory profiles of acute febrile illness patients 
to diagnose dengue. Data of 397 acute undifferentiated febrile illness patients
who visited the fever clinic of the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases,
Thailand, were used for model construction and validation. The two best final
models were selected: one with and one without NS1 rapid test result. The
diagnostic accuracy of the models was compared with that of physicians on the
same set of patients. The Bayesian network models provided good diagnostic
accuracy of dengue infection, with ROC AUC of 0.80 and 0.75 for models with and
without NS1 rapid test result, respectively. The models had approximately 80%
specificity and 70% sensitivity, similar to the diagnostic accuracy of the
hospital's fellows in infectious disease. Including information on NS1 rapid test
improved the specificity, but reduced the sensitivity, both in model and
physician diagnoses. The Bayesian network model developed in this study could be 
useful to assist physicians in diagnosing dengue, particularly in regions where
experienced physicians and laboratory confirmation tests are limited.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an acute, highly contagious viral disease of
domestic and wild cloven-hoofed animals, caused by FMD virus (FMDV). An FMD
outbreak can cause major production losses and have significant implications for 
trade. Vaccination can assist in controlling the disease, and emergency
vaccination using high antigen payload vaccines (>6 PD50/dose) is considered an
important control approach in the event of an outbreak. In recent years there has
been a divergence of serotype A viruses in South East Asia (SEA) into several
distinct genetic and antigenic clusters. Numerous variants were found to poorly
match serotype A vaccines commonly included in international antigen banks. This 
study examined the ability of single vaccination with high-potency monovalent A22
IRQ vaccine to protect sheep following challenge with the A/VIT/15/2012 strain,
just four days following vaccination. The vaccine proved effective at limiting
clinical disease but did not prevent infection.

Spexin Modulates Functions of Rat Endocrine Pancreatic Cells.

Sassek M, Kolodziejski PA, Strowski MZ, Nogowski L, Nowak KW, Mackowiak P.

OBJECTIVES: Spexin is a peptide whose action is poorly understood but which is
expressed in many tissues. This encouraged us to investigate the potential role
of spexin in the regulation of pancreatic secretion.
METHODS: Cells/islets were incubated with different concentrations of glucose and
spexin to measure insulin secretion. MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays and BrdU
(5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) tests were performed to assess the viability and
proliferation of pancreatic islets after spexin treatment. Real-time polymerase
chain reaction was used to detect messenger RNA expression for insulin, insulin
receptor, and Pdx (pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1).
RESULTS: Insulin secretion from cultured cells and isolated islets was reduced by
spexin at 16 mM glucose level. In obese rats, insulin secretion was decreased
after injection with spexin. Spexin treatment showed an increase in cultured
cells and pancreatic islets cell viability and proliferation as well as an
increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein level. In contrast, a
decrease in insulin and Pdx gene expression was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The effects of spexin on insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo and 
also on cells viability and proliferation confirm that this peptide may be
strongly involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes or its recovery.

In this study, we have systematically assessed the influence of postmortem delay 
(PMD) and fixation time (FT) on the immunohistochemical (IHC) staining outcome.
The IHC method is frequently applied on surgical and postmortem samples in
diagnostics and research. To replicate the routine situation, brain tissues from 
pigs were exposed to either storage in a refrigerator (+8¢XC), that is, PMD (1 to 
168?h), or fixed in 10% buffered formalin, that is, FT (18 to 94?d).
Subsequently, the tissue was routinely processed into paraffin blocks to enable
construction of tissue microarrays (TMA). Sections cut from the TMA blocks were
stained applying 13 different antibodies directed against neuronal and glial
antigens. Immunoreactivity applying 5 antibodies was influenced by prolonged PMD 
and applying 2 antibodies by prolonged FT. None of the staining outcomes related 
to the PMD or FT were predictable. Loss of TMA cores during processing was
primarily influenced by pretreatment and by tissue characteristics (gray/white
matter). The test model described here confirmed that these 2 variables, PMD and 
FT, indeed influence the IHC outcome. The PMD and FT are particularly of
importance while assessing tissue samples obtained at autopsy. The result above
is also of importance while comparing the IHC outcomes seen in the postmortem
setting (various PMD/FT) with surgical samples or with IHC outcome seen in
experimental animal setting (controlled PMD/FT). Thus, we suggest that the test
model described here is considered when assessing the reliability of the IHC
outcome when analyzing tissues with various characteristics.

Microevolution and Patterns of Transmission of Shigella sonnei within Cyclic
Outbreaks Shigellosis, Israel.

Behar A, Baker KS, Bassal R, Ezernitchi A, Valinsky L, Thomson NR, Cohen D.

Whole-genome sequencing unveiled host and environment-related insights to
Shigella sonnei transmission within cyclic epidemics during 2000-2012 in Israel. 
The Israeli reservoir contains isolates belonging to S. sonnei lineage III but of
different origin, shows loss of tetracycline resistance genes, and little genetic
variation within the O antigen: highly relevant for Shigella vaccine development.

Cost estimate of platelet transfusion in the United States for patients with
chronic liver disease and associated thrombocytopenia undergoing elective
procedures.

AIMS: This study aimed to estimate the cost of platelet transfusion in patients
with chronic liver disease (CLD)-associated thrombocytopenia undergoing an
elective procedure in the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in 2 parts: development of a
conceptual framework identifying direct, indirect, and intangible costs of
platelet transfusion, followed by the estimation of the total cost of platelet
transfusion in patients with CLD-associated thrombocytopenia before an elective
procedure in the United States using the conceptual framework and cost data
obtained from a literature search. The cost of the entire care required to raise 
a patient's platelet count before the procedure was considered.
RESULTS: The final conceptual framework included the costs of generating the
supply of platelets, the platelet transfusion itself, adverse events associated
with platelet transfusion, and refractoriness to platelet transfusion. When costs
were accounted for in all the framework cost categories, the total direct cost of
a platelet transfusion in a patient with CLD and associated thrombocytopenia was 
estimated to be in the range of $5,258 to $13,117 (2017?US dollars) in the United
States. The largest portion of costs were incurred by the transfusion event
itself ($3,723 to $4,436) and the cost of refractoriness ($874 to $7,578), which 
included the opportunity cost of a delayed procedure and subsequent platelet
transfusions with human leukocyte antigen-matched platelets.
LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although we were unable to include all cost
components identified in the conceptual framework in our total cost estimate,
thus likely underestimating the true total cost, and despite the data gaps, and
challenges limiting our estimate of the full cost of a platelet transfusion in
patients with CLD-associated thrombocytopenia undergoing an elective procedure in
the United States, this study outlines a comprehensive conceptual framework for
estimating the cost elements of a platelet transfusion in these patients.

Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion is a multi-step process that involves 
a spectrum of interactions that are not well characterized. We have characterized
a 113 kDa immunogenic protein PF3D7_1431400 (PF14_0293) that possesses
coiled-coil structures. The protein is localized on the surfaces of both
merozoites and gametocytes, hence the name PlasmodiumfalciparumSurface Related
Antigen (PfSRA). The processed 32 kDa fragment of PfSRA binds normal human
erythrocytes with different sensitivities to enzyme treatments. Temporal imaging 
from initial attachment to internalization of viable merozoites revealed that a
fragment of PfSRA along with PfMSP119 are internalized post-invasion. Moreover,
parasite growth inhibition assays showed that PfSRA P1 antibodies potently
inhibited erythrocyte invasion of both sialic acid-dependent and -independent
parasite strains. Also, immuno-epidemiological studies show that malaria-infected
populations have naturally-acquired antibodies against PfSRA. Overall, the
results demonstrate that PfSRA has the structural and functional characteristics 
of a very promising target for vaccine development.

Background: Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are a prominent cause of gastroenteritis, 
yet fundamental questions remain regarding epidemiology, diversity and immunity
in sub-Saharan African children. We investigated HuNoV seroprevalence and genetic
and sociodemographic risk factors in Ugandan children.
Methods: We randomly screened 797 participants of a longitudinal birth cohort
(EMaBS) in Entebbe, and 378 children from a cross-sectional survey of rural
island communities in Lake Victoria (LaVISSWA), for antibodies against multiple
HuNoV genotypes by ELISA. We used linear regression modelling to test for
associations between HuNoV antibody levels and sociodemographic factors, and for 
associations with the known human susceptibility rs601338 FUT2 Secretor SNP and
histo-blood group antigens (A/B/O).
Results: Of the EMaBS participants, 76¡P6% were seropositive by age 1, rising to
94¡P5% by age 2-years. Seroprevalence in 1-year-olds of the rural LaVISSWA survey 
was even higher (95%). In the birth cohort, 99% of seropositive 2-year-olds had
responses to multiple HuNoV genotypes. We identified associations between
secretor-status and genogroup GII antibody levels (GII.4 p=3.1x10-52), as well as
ABO and GI (GI.2 p=2.1x10-12).
Conclusions: HuNoVs are highly prevalent in Ugandan children, indicating a
substantial burden of diarrhoea-associated morbidity with recurrent infections.
Public health interventions, including vaccination, and increased surveillance
are urgently needed.

Context: Immunotherapy trials to prevent type 1 diabetes have been unsuccessful
for more than fifteen years. Understanding pitfalls and knowledge gaps in the
immunology of type 1 diabetes should lead us in new directions that will yield
better trial outcomes. A proposal is made for precision medicine trial design in 
future type 1 diabetes studies.
Evidence Acquisition: High quality peer-reviewed basic science and clinical
research trials for type 1 diabetes were used in this Perspectives article. Type 
1 diabetes publications were reviewed from the years 2000 to 2018 using Google
Scholar and PubMed reference databases.
Evidence Synthesis: Personalized medicine for type 1 diabetes should recognize
that each individual has phenotypic and genotypic quirks that distinguish them
from other study subjects. A uniform protocol for antigen-specific immunotherapy 
has consistently failed to prevent disease. An alternative approach using
molecular tools to personalize the preventive treatment strategy might be a road 
forward for type 1 diabetes research. Assumptions or lack knowledge about disease
stratification (not all type 1 diabetes is the same disease), individualized
antigen-specific T-cells, regulatory T-cell populations, and T-cell receptor
rearrangement are just a few aspects of immunology that need integration with
clinical trial design.
Conclusions: The type 1 diabetes research community continues to bring forward
novel immunotherapy trials to prevent disease, but this approach is unlikely to
succeed until several fundamental aspects of clinical immunology are recognized
and addressed. Here, we identify several knowledge gaps that could rectify type 1
diabetes trial design and lead to future success.

Dendritic cells (DC) are heterogeneous cell populations that differ in their cell
membrane markers, migration patterns and distribution, and in their antigen
presentation and T cell activation capacities. Since most vaccinations of
experimental tumor models require millions of DC, they are widely isolated from
the bone marrow or spleen. However, these DC significantly differ from blood and 
tumor DC in their responses to immune complexes (IC), and presumably to other
Syk-coupled lectin receptors. Importantly, given the sensitivity of DC to
danger-associated molecules, the presence of endotoxins or antibodies that
crosslink activation receptors in one of the isolating steps could result in the 
priming of DC and thus affect the parameters, or at least the dosage, required to
activate them. Therefore, here we describe a detailed protocol for isolating MoDC
from blood and tumors while avoiding their premature activation. In addition, a
protocol is provided for MoDC activation with tumor IC, and their subsequent
analyses.

Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
characterized by cognitive deficits, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. The
primary pathogenic cause is believed to be the accumulation of pathogenic amyloid
beta (A&beta;) assemblies in the brain. Ghrelin, which is a peptide hormone
predominantly secreted from the stomach, is an endogenous ligand for the growth
hormone secretagogue-receptor type 1a (GHS-R1a). MK-0677 is a ghrelin agonist
that potently stimulates the GHS-R1a ghrelin receptor. Interestingly, previous
studies have shown that ghrelin improves cognitive impairments and attenuates
neuronal death and neuroinflammation in several neurological disorders. However, 
it is unknown whether MK-0677 can affect A&beta; accumulation or A&beta;-mediated
pathology in the brains of patients with AD. Therefore, we examined the effects
of MK-0677 administration on AD-related pathology in 5XFAD mice, an
A&beta;-overexpressing transgenic mouse model of AD. MK-0677 was
intraperitoneally administered to three-month-old 5XFAD mice. To visualize
A&beta; accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, thioflavin-S
staining and immunostaining with antibodies against A&beta; (4G8), ionized
calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN), and synaptophysin were conducted in the 
neocortex of 5XFAD and wild-type mice, and to evaluate changes of phosphorylated 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (pCREB)
levels, immunostaining with antibody against pCREB was performed in dentate gyrus
of the hippocampus of 5XFAD and wild-type mice. The histological analyses
indicated that MK-0677-treated 5XFAD mice showed reduced A&beta; deposition,
gliosis, and neuronal and synaptic loss in the deep cortical layers, and
inhibited the decrement of pCREB levels in dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
compared to vehicle-treated 5XFAD mice. Our results showed that activation of the
ghrelin receptor with MK-0677 inhibited the A&beta; burden, neuroinflammation,
and neurodegeneration, which suggested that MK-0677 might have potential as a
treatment of the early phase of AD.

PURPOSE: To describe our process for preoperative screening and donor selection
for ocular surface stem cell transplantation (OSST).
METHODS: A 7-year retrospective chart review was performed on limbal stem cell
deficiency patients. The inclusion criterion was all patients who underwent an
OSST procedure. The exclusion criterion was eyes with unilateral disease in which
an autograft was performed. Data for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing,
virtual crossmatching, donor-specific antibody, and panel reactive antibody level
were obtained.
RESULTS: Of the included 142 eyes (104 patients), 19 patients had no recorded
living donor availability data, and HLA typing was not performed on 16 patients. 
A total of 94 donors (mean 1.4 donors/patient, range 1-6) were tested for 67
recipients. For 2 patients with graft-versus-host disease, no further HLA typing 
was needed, as the donors were known HLA-identical donors. For 47 patients, only 
1 donor was tested, whereas multiple donors underwent HLA typing for 20 patients.
There were 73 ABO (blood group)-compatible matches for the 61 tested recipients, 
and only 1 recipient did not have any ABO-compatible donor. For the virtual
crossmatch, there were 5 patients who did not have a compatible donor (positive
virtual crossmatch). The best available donor match was a sibling for 41
recipients (65%), a parent for 19 recipients (30%), and an offspring for 3
recipients (5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our protocol for OSST preoperative screening and donor selection
minimizes the antigenic burden for transplanted tissue by selecting the best
available donor match.

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) of chimeric antigen receptor T cells has demonstrated
remarkable success for the treatment of pediatric B-cell leukemia. For patients
who are not candidates for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, ACT using
tumor antigen-experienced polyclonal T cells may be a treatment option. Since
leukemic blasts reside in the bone marrow and bone marrow is a preferred site for
homeostatic proliferation of cytotoxic memory CD8 T cells, we hypothesized that
bone marrow would be a source of activated T cells. The aim of this study was to 
determine the feasibility of using bone marrow-derived T cells following
postinduction chemotherapy for use in adoptive cell transfer. Matched patient
samples of bone marrow and peripheral blood-derived T cells expanded ex vivo and 
displayed similar apoptotic profiles. Before activation and expansion, there was 
a significant increase in the percentage of bone marrow-derived CD8 T cells
expressing activation markers PD1, CD45RO, and CD69 as compared with peripheral
blood CD8 T cells. Considering, melanoma-reactive CD8 T cells reside in the
subset of PD1CD8 T cells, the bone marrow may be an enriched source
leukemic-specific T cells that can be used for ACT.This is an open-access article

HIV infection changes the lymph node (LN) tissue architecture, potentially
impairing the immunologic response to antigenic challenge. The tissue-resident
immune cell dynamics in virologically suppressed HIV+ patients on combination
antiretroviral therapy (cART) are not clear. We obtained LN biopsies before and
10 to 14 days after trivalent seasonal influenza immunization from healthy
controls (HCs) and HIV+ volunteers on cART to investigate CD4+ T follicular
helper (Tfh) and B cell dynamics by flow cytometry and quantitative imaging
analysis. Prior to vaccination, compared with those in HCs, HIV+ LNs exhibited an
altered follicular architecture, but harbored higher numbers of Tfh cells and
increased IgG+ follicular memory B cells. Moreover, Tfh cell numbers were
dependent upon preservation of the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and
were predictive of the magnitude of the vaccine-induced IgG responses.
Interestingly, postvaccination LN samples in HIV+ participants had significantly 
(P = 0.0179) reduced Tfh cell numbers compared with prevaccination samples,
without evidence for peripheral Tfh (pTfh) cell reduction. We conclude that
influenza vaccination alters the cellularity of draining LNs of HIV+ persons in
conjunction with development of antigen-specific humoral responses. The
underlying mechanism of Tfh cell decline warrants further investigation, as it
could bear implications for the rational design of HIV vaccines.

Hospital, Jena, Germany.

OBJECTIVES: Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor) is a rare tumor entity,
which is diagnosed late due to uncharacteristic symptoms. The therapeutic
strategy for cure is still liver resection. Liver transplant in cases of locally 
irresectable tumors represents an alternative potential curative therapy for a
select group of patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present our data of 22 patients with irresectable
Klatskin tumors who received transplants between 1996 and 2015. We analyzed
relevant prognostic factors for the selection of patients to be transplanted to
ensure an acceptable overall survival and reviewed known and established
selection criteria.
RESULTS: Four factors (age, tumor size, serum level of carbohydrate antigen 19-9,
percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage) could be detected for possible
patient selection. Positive lymph node status and advanced tumor stage according 
to the Union for International Cancer Control were confirmed as negative
prognostic factors for survival after transplant.
CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplant is a curative therapy for selected patients with
irresectable Klatskin tumors, but further prospective studies are urgently
needed.

Vaccines, one of the most effective and powerful public health measures, have
saved countless lives over the past century and still have a tremendous global
impact. As an indispensable component of modern vaccines, adjuvants play a
critical role in strengthening and/or shaping a specific immune response against 
infectious diseases as well as malignancies. The application of nanotechnology
provides the possibility of precisely tailoring the building blocks of
nanoadjuvants towards modern vaccines with the desired immune response. The last 
decade has witnessed great academic progress in inorganic nanomaterials for
vaccine adjuvants in terms of nanometer-scale synthesis, structure control, and
functionalization design. Inorganic adjuvants generally facilitate the delivery
of antigens, allowing them to be released in a sustained manner, enhance
immunogenicity, deliver antigens efficiently to specific targets, and induce a
specific immune response. In particular, the recent discovery of the intrinsic
immunomodulatory function of inorganic nanomaterials further allows us to shape
the immune response towards the desired type and increase the efficacy of
vaccines. In this article, we comprehensively review state-of-the-art research on
the use of inorganic nanomaterials as vaccine adjuvants. Attention is focused on 
the physicochemical properties of versatile inorganic nanoadjuvants, such as
composition, size, morphology, shape, hydrophobicity, and surface charge, to
effectively stimulate cellular immunity, considering that the clinically used
alum adjuvants can only induce strong humoral immunity. In addition, the efforts 
made to date to expand the application of inorganic nanoadjuvants in cancer
vaccines are summarized. Finally, we discuss the future prospects and our outlook
on tailoring inorganic nanoadjuvants towards next-generation vaccines.

Energy metabolism is essential for T cell function. However, how persistent
antigenic stimulation affects T cell metabolism is unknown. Here, we report that 
long-term in vivo antigenic exposure induced a specific deficit in numerous
metabolic enzymes. Accordingly, T cells exhibited low basal glycolytic flux and
limited respiratory capacity. Strikingly, blockade of inhibitory receptor PD-1
stimulated the production of IFN£^ in chronic T cells, but failed to shift their
metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis, as observed in effector T cells. Instead, 
chronic T cells appeared to rely on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty 
acid oxidation (FAO) to produce ATP for IFN£^ synthesis. Check-point blockade,
however, increased mitochondrial production of superoxide and reduced viability
and effector function. Thus, in the absence of a glycolytic switch, PD-1-mediated
inhibition appears essential for limiting oxidative metabolism linked to effector
function in chronic T cells, thereby promoting survival and functional fitness.

Inflammatory bowel disease: new therapies from antisense oligonucleotides.

Marafini I(1), Monteleone G(1).

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions of the
gastrointestinal tract encompassing two main clinical entities: Crohn's disease
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These disorders are characterized by various
grades of tissue damage and development of local complications and
extra-intestinal manifestations. The cause of IBD remains unknown but
accumulating evidence indicates that both CD and UC arise in
genetically-predisposed individuals as a result of the action of multiple
environmental factors, which ultimately trigger excessive and poorly-controlled
immune response against antigens of the luminal flora. In spite of this
realization, a full understanding of IBD pathogenesis is still out of reach and, 
consequently, treatment is far from optimal. However, in recent years, several
pathways of intestinal damage have been delineated and the improved knowledge has
contributed to the development of new therapies. Various approaches have been
used to either inhibit the expression and/or function of inflammatory molecules
or enhance counter-regulatory mechanisms. This review summarizes the available
pre-clinical and clinical data for antisense oligonucleotides and
oligonucleotides to provide a comprehensive understanding of the rationale and
mechanism of action of these compounds in IBD.

Vaccines to protect livestock against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP)
consist in inactivated, adjuvanted antigens. Quality control of these vaccines is
challenging as total protein quantification provides no indication of protein
identity or purity, and culture is not an option. Here, a tandem mass
spectrometry approach was used to identify the mycoplasma antigen contained in
reference samples and in commercial CCPP vaccines. By the same approach, the
relative amounts of mycoplasma antigen and residual proteins originating from the
production medium were determined. Mass spectrometry allowed easy and rapid
identification of the peptides present in the vaccine samples. Alongside the most
probable mycoplasma species effectively present in the vaccines, a very high
proportion of peptides from medium constituents was detected in the commercial
vaccines tested. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular apicomplexan, causes latent
infection in about one third of the human population. During latent infection, T.
gondii bradyzoites are found within cysts, a modified parasitophorous vacuole.
This parasite has a large family of SRS (surface antigen-1 related sequence)
proteins which are reported to be involved in attachment of these organisms to
their mammalian host cells and in immune subversion during latent infection. We
have identified a novel mucin domain containing SRS protein, using a
glycoepitope-specific antibody, which recognizes the cyst wall. SRS13 has two SRS
domains and between these domains is a threonine-rich tandem repeat mucin-like
domain that is similar to the mucin-like domain seen in another cyst wall
specific SRS protein CST1 (SRS44). SRS13 is upregulated in bradyzoites and
O-GalNAc glycosylated by ppGalNAc-T2 and T3. Similar to the cyst wall protein
CST1, SRS13 localizes to the cyst wall, but unlike CST1, SRS13 is dispensable for
normal cyst wall formation. Together, these findings elucidate the role of a
second SRS mucin domain protein, SRS13, in bradyzoite biology and expands the
previously reported functions of the SRS protein family.

Foot and mouth disease is an economically important transboundary disease of
wildlife and cloven hoofed animals including ruminants. In the absence of
vaccination, detection of antibodies against structural proteins (SPs) of
foot-and-mouth disease virus is an indicator of infection. In the present study, 
a rapid dot blot assay using gold nanoparticlees was developed for the detection 
of antibodies against SPs of FMDV. Commercially available FMD vaccine was used as
a source of FMD antigen. After the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs), the
GNP-dot blot assay was tested and was found very sensitive, as the detection of
antibody was up to 10-4 of serum dilution. The GNP-dot assay was found specific
as it didn't give dot with normal horse sera, fetal bovine sera and neonatal
bovine calf serum samples when tested at 10-3 working dilution. When 30 serum
samples from post-vaccinated buffaloes were tested at dilution of 10-3, all the
samples were found positive with the variable intensity of dot. The synthesized
GNPs and conjugated GNPS with antibody were characterized for their absorption
limit, for their stability and for their approximate size. These characterized
conjugated and non-conjugated GNPs were also analyzed by Transmission electron
microscopy and Scanning electron microscopy. The GNP dot blot assay developed in 
this work gave promising results using vaccine antigen and can form an important 
tool for rapid diagnosis of FMD in FMD free countries, zones free of FMD and
during last stage of FMD eradication when FMD vaccination will be withdrawn.

Serum therapy fell out of favor 80 years ago, but antibodies against infectious
diseases are now experiencing a renaissance. With the evolution of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the emergence of new pathogens, and a growing
population of immunocompromised individuals coupled with improvements in antibody
manufacturing and biological efficacy, antibodies are an increasingly attractive 
therapeutic option. In this review, we highlight successful clinical strategies
and discuss recent applications of advanced antibody engineering approaches to
combat infectious diseases. Case studies include antibody mixtures to neutralize 
Staphylococcus aureus; bispecific antibodies promoting Pseudomonas aeruginosa
clearance; antibody-antibiotic conjugates to eradicate S. aureus from protected
intracellular niches; and novel anti-RSV antibodies with extended serum
half-life. These new designs are powerful strategies for targeting infectious
diseases due to their abilities to target multiple antigens and induce novel
clearance mechanisms.
